# About

This project is an experiment in open science and model development. We'll be live-blogging the process of building a new, state-of-the-art typhoid immune model for use in transmission modeling and vaccine schedule recommendations. Documentation will grow as the model stabilizes, and all code will be available in flight.

Please follow along and don't hesitate to comment via github issues, or send me an email at mike-dot-famulare-at-gatesfoundation-dot-org.
