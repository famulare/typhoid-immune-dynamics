# Overview

This **Docs** section contains stand-alone documentation of the science and software supporting IDM's new typhoid immunity model. 

All data, code, writing, and results associated with this project are available on Github at [famulare/typhoid-immune-dynamics](https://github.com/famulare/typhoid-immune-dynamics).

Major components include:

- **Literature Review** to describe the questions we want the model to help answer and data required to fit the model.

- Descriptions of the **Model Architecture** that document the mathematics and software design.

- **Calibration** to estimate model parameters from data.

- **Model Diagnostics** to quantify goodness of fit and identify issues with the model, data, or both.

- and **Doing Science** with the model.
