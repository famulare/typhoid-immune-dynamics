# NIBSC 16/138 Data Extraction

## Source

NIBSC. Instructions for Use: 1st International Standard for Anti-Typhoid capsular Vi polysaccharide IgG (Human). **NIBSC code: 16/138**. Version 5.0, Dated 23/01/2024.

Supporting publication: Rijpkema S, Hockley J, Logan A, et al. Establishment of the first International Standard for human anti-typhoid capsular Vi polysaccharide IgG. Biologicals 2018;56:29-38.

## Key Parameters

### Assigned Unitage

| Material | Code | Assigned Value |
|----------|------|----------------|
| 1st International Standard | NIBSC 16/138 | **100 IU/ampoule** |
| US Reference Reagent | Vi-IgGR1,2011 | 163 IU (relative to 16/138) |
| Predecessor candidate | NIBSC 10/126 | 54 IU (relative to 16/138) |

### Contents

- 1 mL freeze-dried pooled serum per ampoule
- Pool from 16 volunteers:
  - 9 immunized with Vi-Tetanus Toxoid conjugate
  - 7 immunized with plain Vi
- Country of origin: United Kingdom
- Storage: -20°C

## Intended Use

"The intended use of IS 16/138 is for standardisation of Vi serology and Vi immuno assays used in clinical trial studies of Vi vaccines."

## Commutability Statement

From the IFU:

> "Indirect, in-house ELISAs (which use a protein in a pre-coating or co-coating step) of native Vi are commutable with the VaccZyme ELISA."

**Important caveat**: Biotinylated Vi ELISAs showed poor commutability with VaccZyme.

## Collaborative Study Results (from Rijpkema 2018)

### Assay Formats Tested

1. VaccZyme ELISA (Binding Site) - Commercial
2. NIBSC biotinylated Vi ELISA
3. 7 in-house ELISAs (various coatings)

### Commutability Outcomes

| Assay Type | Commutable with VaccZyme? |
|------------|---------------------------|
| In-house indirect (protein pre-coat) | **Yes** |
| In-house indirect (poly-L-lysine) | **Yes** |
| VaccZyme | Reference |
| Biotinylated Vi formats | **No** |

### Potency Estimates

Relative potency of 16/138 vs Vi-IgGR1,2011 was consistent in:
- VaccZyme ELISA
- Protein-based in-house ELISAs

High variability (0.20 to 6.24) observed in ELISA formats using biotinylated Vi.

## Relevance to E4 Bridge

### What E4 Provides

E4 (VaccZyme → IS-relative IU) is primarily a **structural/definitional** edge:
- VaccZyme kit calibrators are already traceable to international standards
- The IS defines the unit, not a conversion factor
- When VaccZyme reports EU/ml calibrated to 16/138, this IS IU/ml

### Conversion Notes

From Szu 2013 and Lee 2020:
- Vi-IgGR1,2011: 33 μg/ml = 163 IU relative to 16/138
- Therefore: 1 IU ≈ 33/163 ≈ 0.20 μg/ml (relative to Vi-IgGR1,2011)
- Or equivalently: 1 μg/ml ≈ 4.94 IU

**Caution**: These conversions are assay-dependent and should be used with care.

## Quality Information

- Tested negative for: HBsAg, anti-HIV, HCV RNA
- Stability: Lyophilized, stable at -20°C
- Reconstitution: 1.0 mL distilled water

## Limitations

1. **Arbitrary unitage**: 100 IU is assigned, not measured
2. **Vaccinee pool only**: May not represent natural infection antibodies
3. **No weight-based assignment**: IU are relative, not μg/ml
4. **Format-dependent**: Not commutable with biotinylated Vi ELISAs
