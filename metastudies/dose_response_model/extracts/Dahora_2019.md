IgA and IgG1 Specific to Vi Polysaccharide of Salmonella Typhi Correlate With Protection Status in a Typhoid Fever Controlled Human Infection Model. Front Immunol. 2019;10:2582. doi: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.02582

## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Identify antibody characteristics (subclass, avidity) that correlate with protection against typhoid fever following Vi vaccination
- **Study type**: Secondary immunological analysis of VAST trial (NCT02324751) samples
- **Institution**: Duke Human Vaccine Institute & Oxford Vaccine Group
- **Population**: Healthy typhoid-naive adults vaccinated with Vi-PS or Vi-TT, then challenged
- **Registration**: NCT02324751 (parent VAST trial)

**[CRITICAL]** This paper does NOT provide new dose-response data. It analyzes antibody correlates from the VAST vaccine efficacy trial (Jin et al. 2017, Lancet) which challenged vaccinated and control subjects at a fixed dose. Key value is detailed characterization of vaccine-induced immunity and correlates of protection.

## Subject Characteristics

### Demographics (p.3, Methods)
- **N total**: 72 vaccinees challenged (Vi-PS n=35, Vi-TT n=37)
- **Age**: Not specified in this paper; see Jin 2017 for full demographics
- **Population**: "Healthy adult volunteers" (p.3)
- **Ethnicity**: Not specified; UK-based study

### Exclusion Criteria (implied from parent study)
- Prior typhoid vaccination or infection
- **[OPEN]** Full exclusion criteria in Jin et al. 2017; this paper does not detail

## Challenge Protocol

### Strain & Delivery
- **Strain**: Quailes strain S. Typhi (same as Maryland and Waddington studies)
- **Delivery**: Oral ingestion (bicarbonate solution, per Oxford protocol)
- **Dose**: Not explicitly stated in this paper
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Per Jin 2017 and Waddington 2014, challenge dose was 1-5 x 10^4 CFU in sodium bicarbonate

### Timeline (p.3)
- **Day -28 (D-28)**: Vaccination (baseline/pre-vaccination)
- **Day 0 (D0)**: Challenge (4 weeks post-vaccination)
- **Day 90 (D90)**: 3 months post-challenge follow-up
- **Day 180 (D180)**: 6 months post-challenge follow-up

## Vaccines Administered

### Vi-PS (Typhim Vi)
- **Type**: Purified Vi polysaccharide vaccine
- **Dose**: Single dose, intramuscular
- **T-cell engagement**: None (T-cell independent antigen)

### Vi-TT (Typbar TCV)
- **Type**: Vi polysaccharide conjugated to tetanus toxoid
- **Dose**: Single dose, intramuscular
- **T-cell engagement**: Yes (conjugate enables T-cell help)
- **WHO prequalified** (noted p.2)

## Illness Definition (p.3)

**Typhoid Diagnosis** ("Diagnosed"):
1. Temperature ≥38°C sustained for ≥12 hours, OR
2. S. Typhi bacteremia (positive blood culture)

**Protected**: Did not meet diagnosis criteria

**[CRITICAL]** Same fever definition as Waddington 2014 Oxford studies (≥38°C = 100.4°F), more sensitive than Maryland definition (≥103°F = 39.4°C)

## Attack Rate Data (p.2, p.8)

**[KEY DATA - VACCINE EFFICACY OUTCOMES]**

| Vaccine Group | N Challenged | N Diagnosed | Attack Rate |
|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Vi-PS         | 35           | 13          | 37%         |
| Vi-TT         | 37           | 13          | 35%         |

**[OPEN]** Control group data not included in this paper; see Jin 2017 for unvaccinated attack rates.

### Protection Status by Vaccine Group (Table 2, p.8)

| Vaccine | N Diagnosed | N Protected |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Vi-PS   | 13          | 22          |
| Vi-TT   | 13          | 24          |

## Baseline Immunity Data (D-28)

### Pre-vaccination Antibody Levels (p.4)
- **[CRITICAL]** "There was no difference in baseline responses between diagnosed vaccinees and protected vaccinees" (p.4)
- Pre-existing immunity did not predict vaccine responsiveness or protection

### Vi-specific Antibodies at Baseline
- Measurable baseline Vi antibodies present in some subjects
- Only significant baseline difference: IgA to tetanus toxoid differed between vaccine responders and non-responders (median MFI 563 vs <100 at 1:50 dilution)

### Prior Typhoid History
- **[OPEN]** All subjects typhoid-naive (exclusion criterion of parent trial)
- No prior typhoid vaccination or infection

## Post-Vaccination Antibody Data (D0 = Day of Challenge)

### IgG Subclass Distribution (Table 1A, p.6; Table 2, p.8)

| Subclass | Vaccine | Response Rate | Median Magnitude | Range |
|----------|---------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| IgG1     | Vi-PS   | 23% (8/35)    | 3.82E4           | 1.00E4-4.88E6 |
| IgG1     | Vi-TT   | 76% (28/37)   | 2.49E5           | 1.00E4-2.30E6 |
| IgG2     | Vi-PS   | 29% (10/35)   | 6.25E4           | 4.00E3-5.44E6 |
| IgG2     | Vi-TT   | 46% (17/37)   | 1.59E5           | 4.00E3-2.35E8 |
| IgG3     | Vi-PS   | 31% (11/35)   | 5.00E3           | 5.00E3-3.55E6 |
| IgG3     | Vi-TT   | 78% (29/37)   | 1.31E4           | 5.00E3-3.17E5 |
| IgG4     | Both    | Below LOD     | -                | -             |

### IgA Response (Table 1A, p.6)

| Subclass | Vaccine | Response Rate | Median Magnitude | Range |
|----------|---------|---------------|------------------|-------|
| Total IgA| Vi-PS   | 88% (30/34)   | 4.71E5           | 2.43E4-5.78E6 |
| Total IgA| Vi-TT   | 97% (36/37)   | 1.05E6           | 9.78E4-1.86E7 |

**[CRITICAL]** IgA dominated vaccine-elicited response despite IgG2 being highest concentration subclass. IgA1 showed highest fold-change from baseline (p.4, Figure 1C).

### Antibody Concentrations (Figure 1A, p.5)
At D0 (positive responders only):
- Vi IgG2: Median ~10-20 µg/ml (predominant IgG subclass)
- Vi IgA: Median ~0.1-1 µg/ml
- Vi IgG1: Median ~0.01-100 µg/ml (wide range)
- Vi IgG3: Very low (<0.1 µg/ml)

## Antibody Correlates of Protection

### Vi IgA (Tables 2-3, p.8-10; Figures 2-3, p.7, 11)

**Vi-PS Group (significant associations):**
- nViPS IgA magnitude: FDR p=0.01 (protected > diagnosed)
- nViPS IgA fold-change: FDR p=0.02 (protected > diagnosed)

**Vi-TT Group (trending associations):**
- ViBiot IgA fold-change: FDR p=0.06 (not significant at p<0.05)
- IgA avidity: FDR p=0.23 (not significant)

### Vi IgA Concentrations by Protection Status (Figure 3C, p.11)

| Vaccine | Protection Status | Median nViPS IgA (µg/ml WHO IS equivalents) |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Vi-PS   | Diagnosed        | 227                                         |
| Vi-PS   | Protected        | 504 (~2-fold higher)                        |
| Vi-TT   | Diagnosed        | 595                                         |
| Vi-TT   | Protected        | 2,118 (~3.5-fold higher)                    |

**[CRITICAL]** "There was no threshold above which 100% of individuals were protected" (p.5) - suggests other immune mechanisms contribute

### Vi IgG1 Avidity (Table 2, p.8; Figure 5, p.14)

**Vi-TT Group:**
- ViBiot IgG1 avidity index: Higher in protected (median 46%) vs diagnosed (median 22%)
- FDR p=0.058 (trending but not significant at p<0.05)

**Vi-PS Group:**
- Not tested due to low responder numbers

### Summary of Immune Signatures (Figure 6, p.14)

**Vi-PS protected individuals:**
- Significantly higher: Vi IgA magnitude, Vi IgA fold-change
- 5-fold higher: Vi IgA2 magnitude and fold-change vs diagnosed

**Vi-TT protected individuals:**
- Trending higher: Vi IgG1 avidity, total IgA fold-change, IgA1 fold-change, IgA2 avidity
- No single statistically significant marker

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Different vaccines elicit protection through potentially different mechanisms despite similar overall efficacy

## Avidity Data (Table 1B, p.6; Table 4, p.13)

### Avidity Index by Subclass at D0 (%)

| Subclass | Vi-PS Median | Vi-PS Range | Vi-TT Median | Vi-TT Range |
|----------|--------------|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| IgG1     | 18.5         | 0-102       | 32           | 2-125       |
| IgG2     | 27           | 2-74        | 47           | 9-91        |
| IgG3     | 9            | 1-50        | 35           | 12-68       |
| IgA      | 38.5         | 8-63        | 42           | 4-90        |

**[CRITICAL]** Vi-TT vaccine increased IgG3 avidity significantly (FDR p=0.005) compared to Vi-PS. Other subclass avidities trended higher but not significant.

### Off-rate (Dissociation) of Purified IgG (Table 4, p.13)

| Time Point | Vi-PS Median kd (s^-1) | Vi-TT Median kd (s^-1) |
|------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| D0         | 1.44E-03               | 8.13E-04               |
| D90        | 1.28E-03               | 1.04E-03               |
| D180       | 2.12E-03               | 1.28E-03               |

No significant change in avidity post-challenge.

## Clinical Outcome Differences (referenced from Jin 2017, p.13)

**Vi-TT diagnosed vaccinees:**
- Less severe symptoms
- Most had positive bacteremia WITHOUT fever
- More likely to self-resolve

**Vi-PS diagnosed vaccinees:**
- More severe symptoms
- Higher proportion had BOTH fever AND bacteremia

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Using field definition (requires both fever + bacteremia): Vi-TT efficacy 87.1% vs Vi-PS efficacy 52.3% (post-hoc analysis cited p.13)

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Modern prospective CHIM with systematic sampling
- Multiple antibody subclasses and avidity measured
- Both IgG and IgA characterized
- WHO International Standards used for quantification
- Individual-level data on protection status
- FDR correction for multiple comparisons

### Limitations
- Small sample size (13 diagnosed per vaccine group)
- Control group not included in this analysis
- Challenge dose not specified (reference to Jin 2017)
- Typhoid-naive UK adults; may not generalize to endemic populations
- No mucosal antibody measurements (serum only)
- Single time point challenge (peak immunity at 4 weeks)

## Fit Role Assessment

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **SUPPORT** - Does not provide primary dose-response data (single challenge dose). Key contributions:
1. Quantifies vaccine-induced Vi antibody levels (IgA, IgG subclasses) at time of challenge
2. Demonstrates IgA as potential correlate of protection
3. Provides vaccine efficacy estimates at Oxford CHIM doses
4. Shows no protective threshold for antibody levels

**Not suitable for dose-response curve fitting** - all challenges at single dose level.

**Useful for:**
- Calibrating immune protection models
- Understanding protective antibody thresholds (or lack thereof)
- Comparing vaccine-induced immunity to natural immunity

## Key Extractions for Modeling

### Vaccine Efficacy at Oxford Challenge Dose (~10^4 CFU)

| Vaccine | N | N Diagnosed | Attack Rate | VE vs unvaccinated* |
|---------|---|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Vi-PS   | 35| 13          | 37%         | ~54%                |
| Vi-TT   | 37| 13          | 35%         | ~55%                |

*Efficacy estimates from Jin 2017; unvaccinated attack rate ~77% at same dose

### Antibody Levels in Protected vs Diagnosed (nViPS IgA, µg/ml)

| Group        | N    | Median | Range (approx) |
|--------------|------|--------|----------------|
| Vi-PS Protected | 22 | 504    | ~50-5000       |
| Vi-PS Diagnosed | 13 | 227    | ~10-500        |
| Vi-TT Protected | 24 | 2118   | ~500-50000     |
| Vi-TT Diagnosed | 13 | 595    | ~50-5000       |

**[OPEN]** These antibody levels could potentially inform correlate of protection (CoP) thresholds, but paper explicitly notes no absolute threshold confers 100% protection.

### Attack Rate by Antibody Response

**[OPEN]** Individual-level antibody and outcome data not provided in paper. Group-level summaries only. Contact authors for deidentified individual data if needed for modeling.
