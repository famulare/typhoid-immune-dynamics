## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Demonstrate utility of culture-PCR methodology for detecting S. Typhi DNA in peripheral blood during human typhoid challenge model development
- **Study type**: Prospective controlled human infection model (CHIM) with novel diagnostic endpoint evaluation
- **Institution**: University of Oxford, Oxford Vaccine Group (with collaborators at Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, University of Maryland, Emergent Biosolutions)
- **Publication type**: Conference poster abstract (15th ICID, June 2012)
- **Registration**: Not stated in abstract

**[CRITICAL]** This is a conference abstract with limited methodological detail. This appears to describe the same cohort later published in full as Waddington et al. 2014. The abstract focuses on culture-PCR findings rather than dose-response, but provides some summary dose-outcome data.

## Subject Characteristics

### Demographics
- **N total**: 40 healthy adult participants challenged
- **Age**: Not specified (described only as "healthy adult")
- **Sex**: Not specified
- **Ethnicity**: Not specified

**[OPEN]** Demographic details absent from abstract; full details likely available in Waddington 2014 publication.

### Exclusion Criteria
- Not explicitly stated in abstract
- Described as "healthy adult participants"

## Challenge Protocol

### Strain & Delivery
- **Strain**: Quailes strain S. Typhi (explicitly stated in title and methods)
- **Delivery medium**: Not specified in abstract
- **Fasting**: Not stated
- **Inoculum volume**: Not stated

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Based on institutional continuity with Waddington 2014, delivery likely in sodium bicarbonate solution, but this cannot be confirmed from the abstract alone.

### Dose Information (p. e215, Methods section)
Two dose groups:
- **Low dose**: 1-5 × 10^3 CFU
- **High dose**: 1-5 × 10^4 CFU

**[OPEN]** Doses reported as ranges (1-5 ×) rather than single values. This may reflect:
1. Dose variability between participants within a dose group
2. Standard way of expressing order of magnitude
3. Actual measured CFU ranges

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** For modeling purposes, these ranges likely correspond to target doses of 10^3 and 10^4 CFU, consistent with Waddington 2014 dose-escalation design.

### Dose Measurement Basis
- Stated as "colony-forming units" (CFU)
- No details on plating/enumeration method

## Baseline Immunity

**[OPEN]** No baseline immunity data reported in abstract:
- Prior typhoid history: Not stated
- Prior vaccination: Not stated (likely excluded based on standard CHIM protocols)
- Baseline serology: Not reported

## Outcome Definitions (p. e215, Results section)

### Typhoid Diagnosis (Composite Endpoint)
Explicitly defined as meeting EITHER criterion:
1. Development of bacteraemia (positive blood culture), OR
2. Persistent fever >38°C for >12 hours

**[CRITICAL]** This is the same case definition used in Waddington 2014 (38°C threshold, 12-hour duration).

### Culture-PCR Endpoint (Novel)
- **Method**: 5 mL venous whole-blood collected into heparin, 5-hour culture in 5% ox-bile tryptone soya broth, DNA extraction, PCR amplifying fliC-d gene
- **Interpretation**: Detection of bacterial DNA in peripheral circulation

## Ascertainment Schedule (p. e215, Methods section)
- **Follow-up period**: 2 weeks after challenge
- **Visit frequency**: Reviewed daily
- **Blood sampling**: "Routine" microbiological culture and novel culture-PCR assay collected (frequency not specified, but described as regular throughout 2-week period)
- **Total samples**: 684 culture-PCR samples, 674 routine blood culture samples collected across 40 participants

## Dose-Outcome Data

### Summary Data from Abstract (p. e215, Results section)

**Overall Results (Both Dose Groups Combined):**

| Endpoint | N positive samples | Total samples | Sample-level positivity |
|----------|-------------------|---------------|------------------------|
| Culture-PCR positive | 57 | 684 | 8.3% |
| Routine blood culture positive | 53 | 674 | 7.9% |

**[OPEN]** These are sample-level, not participant-level statistics. The abstract does not provide attack rates by dose group.

### Participant-Level Outcomes

**Early Culture-PCR (≤5 days post-challenge, culture-negative):**
- 10/40 participants had positive culture-PCR within 5 days (with negative routine cultures)
- Of these 10: 7 went on to develop typhoid infection (per composite definition)

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This suggests culture-PCR detects bacteraemia earlier than routine culture, with positive results from 12 hours post-challenge.

**Overall Typhoid Diagnosis Rate:**
- Not explicitly stated by dose group in abstract

**Asymptomatic DNAaemia:**
- 5/40 participants had detectable DNA in peripheral circulation but did NOT meet typhoid diagnosis criteria
- Several of these had "mild symptoms or elevation of inflammatory markers (including C-reactive protein) only"

**[CRITICAL]** This finding of 5/40 (12.5%) asymptomatic bacteraemia/DNAaemia is important for understanding subclinical infection.

### Reconstructed Attack Rate Data

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Based on statements in abstract:
- Total challenged: 40
- Early culture-PCR positive (≤5 days): 10
  - Of whom developed typhoid: 7
- Asymptomatic DNAaemia (did not meet diagnosis): 5

The abstract states these 10 early-positive participants include 7 who later met typhoid diagnosis criteria. The 5 asymptomatic participants are described separately.

**[OPEN]** Cannot determine:
- Total number diagnosed with typhoid (not stated)
- Attack rate by dose group (10^3 vs 10^4)
- Sample sizes per dose group

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Modern prospective CHIM study with systematic sampling
- Novel PCR endpoint provides additional sensitivity
- Clear composite case definition stated
- Daily follow-up for 2 weeks

### Limitations
- **Conference abstract format**: Very limited detail
- **No dose-stratified attack rates**: Cannot construct dose-response curves from this abstract alone
- **Sample sizes per dose group**: Not reported
- **No denominator clarity**: Cannot determine total typhoid diagnoses
- **No baseline immunity data**
- **No individual-level data**

## Cross-References

### Relationship to Other Papers
- **Waddington et al. 2014**: This abstract almost certainly describes preliminary data from the same cohort published in full in Waddington 2014. The 40 participants, Quailes strain, dose ranges, and case definition all match.
- **Darton et al. 2017** (if exists): The abstract mentions ongoing culture-PCR methodology development; later publications may provide more detail
- **Same strain**: Quailes strain, same as Maryland studies (Hornick series) and Waddington 2014

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This abstract should be treated as a preliminary report of the Waddington 2014 cohort rather than independent data. The n=40 here likely corresponds to the n=41 in Waddington 2014 (±1 participant difference may reflect enrollment timing of abstract submission).

### Cohort Overlap Assessment
**[CRITICAL]** High probability of complete overlap with Waddington 2014 data. Should NOT be used as independent calibration data.

## Fit Role Assessment

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **EXCLUDE** from primary dose-response calibration for the following reasons:

1. **Conference abstract with insufficient detail**: No dose-stratified attack rates provided
2. **Likely complete cohort overlap**: Almost certainly preliminary data from Waddington 2014 cohort
3. **No unique dose-response information**: Any useful data is better captured in full Waddington 2014 publication

**Support role**: May be useful for:
- Understanding culture-PCR methodology development
- Documenting asymptomatic infection rates (5/40 with subclinical bacteraemia)
- Confirming timeline of Oxford CHIM development

## Key Observations for Model Development

### Subclinical Infection
The finding that 5/40 (12.5%) participants had detectable DNAaemia without meeting typhoid diagnosis criteria is relevant for:
- Understanding infection vs disease distinction
- Informing P(fever|infection) component of model
- Sensitivity analysis on case definitions

### Early Bacteraemia Detection
Culture-PCR detected positive results from 12 hours post-challenge, suggesting:
- Primary dissemination occurs very early
- Standard blood cultures miss early/low-level bacteraemia
- Infection may be more common than diagnosed disease

**[OPEN]** These findings support the model structure separating P(infection|dose) from P(fever|infection), but quantitative data insufficient for direct calibration from this abstract.
