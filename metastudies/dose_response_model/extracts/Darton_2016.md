## Study Overview

### Design
- Phase 2b randomised, double-blind (M01ZH09 vs placebo), placebo-controlled trial with open-label Ty21a comparator arm
- Single center: Oxford Vaccine Group, Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK
- Enrollment period: November 28, 2011 to June 27, 2012

### Primary Objective
Assess protective efficacy of single-dose M01ZH09 vs placebo against S. Typhi challenge 28 days after vaccination

### Arms
1. **M01ZH09** (n=33 randomized, n=31 per-protocol): Single oral dose, 1x10^10 CFU live attenuated S. Typhi (Ty2 ΔaroC ΔssaV)
2. **Placebo** (n=33 randomized, n=30 per-protocol): Excipients only (M9S basal medium + 10% sucrose)
3. **Ty21a** (n=33 randomized, n=30 per-protocol): Open-label, 3 doses enteric-coated capsules on alternate days (≥2x10^9 CFU per dose)

---

## Challenge Protocol

### Strain
- **S. Typhi Quailes strain** (wild-type, virulent)
- Same strain used in prior Oxford dose-escalation study (Waddington et al. 2014)

### Dose
- **Target dose:** 1-5 x 10^4 CFU (to achieve ~65% attack rate in placebo)
- **Actual median dose administered:** 1.82 x 10^4 CFU (range: 1.46-2.66 x 10^4 CFU) [p.7, S1 Fig p.24-25]

### Delivery Method
- Oral ingestion after 90-minute fast
- Pre-treatment: 12g NaHCO3 in 120mL water (to neutralize gastric acid)
- Challenge inoculum: suspended in 0.53g NaHCO3 in 30mL water, ingested 2 minutes after bicarbonate
- Post-challenge: 90-minute observation period [p.5]

### Timing
- Challenge administered median 27 days (range: 21-33 days) after vaccine course completion [p.7]
- 14-day follow-up period post-challenge

|----------------|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Male sex, n (%) | 22 (66.7) | 19 (57.6) | 23 (69.7) |
| Age years, median (IQR) | 24 (21-43) | 23 (21-39) | 25 (22-31) |
| White British ethnicity, n (%) | 29 (87.9) | 31 (93.9) | 28 (84.8) |
| Student, % | 43.8 | 45.5 | 45.2 |
| Employed, % | 31.3 | 45.5 | 48.4 |
| Previous travel to endemic area (<6 mo), % | 31.2 | 24.2 | 33.3 |

**Overall population:** Median age 30.2 years (range 19-60), 64.6% male, 88.9% white British ethnicity [p.7]

### Inclusion Criteria
- Healthy men and non-pregnant women
- Aged 18-60 years
- No previous history of typhoid vaccination, infection, or likely exposure to S. Typhi [p.3]

### Exclusion Criteria (selected)

---

## Baseline Immunity

### Serology

**Anti-Vi IgG Antibodies (pre-vaccination, Day -28):**
- Detectable levels (>7.4 EU/mL, lower limit of detection) found in:
  - M01ZH09: 6/32 (19%)
  - Placebo: 12/30 (40%)
  - Ty21a: 8/29 (28%)
- These levels were above the 75th percentile in UK adult blood donors (n=81) [p.13]
- **Key finding:** Pre-existing anti-Vi antibody was significantly protective (see Outcomes) [p.2, p.13]

**Anti-LPS, Anti-H (flagellin) Antibodies:**
- Baseline levels similar between groups (S2 Table, S3 Table) [p.11]

### Prior Typhoid Exposure
- No previous typhoid vaccination or clinical infection (by history and GP records) [p.3]
- 29.6% reported short-term travel (<6 months) to endemic areas [p.7]
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** The unexpected finding of detectable anti-Vi IgG in ~29% of participants despite no known typhoid exposure suggests possible subclinical exposure or cross-reactive antibodies (e.g., from Citrobacter freundii) [p.19]

### Vaccination Status
- All participants typhoid vaccine-naive at enrollment [p.3]

*Hazard ratio per 1 log10 increase in anti-Vi IgG titre

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Randomised, double-blind (M01ZH09 vs placebo), well-controlled design [p.3]
- Intensive daily follow-up with standardized outcome definitions [p.5]
- Quantitative microbiology (blood cultures, stool cultures) [p.5, p.9]
- Automated blood culture technology (more sensitive than historical studies) [p.20]
- Individual-level data available in S1 Dataset [p.24]
- Challenge dose measured directly by plating from challenge suspension [p.24-25]

### Limitations
- **Single dose level:** Only 10^4 CFU tested; no dose-response curve within this study [p.2]
- **High attack rate/stringent model:** 67% in placebo vs 53% in historical Maryland studies at 10^5 CFU [p.15]
- **Short vaccination-challenge interval:** 28 days may be insufficient for full immune maturation [p.20]
- **Two-week follow-up limit:** May miss late diagnoses [p.2]
- **Typhoid-naive population:** Results may not extrapolate directly to endemic settings [p.20]
- **Imbalanced baseline anti-Vi:** 40% of placebo vs 19% of M01ZH09 had detectable baseline anti-Vi; this confounds the primary analysis [p.13]
- **Ty21a arm open-label:** Potential for bias in symptom reporting [p.4]

## Fit Role Assessment

### Recommendation: **Support**

### Rationale

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]**

This study provides valuable supporting data for dose-response modeling but is not ideal as a core dataset due to:

**Strengths for dose-response modeling:**
1. Well-characterized single challenge dose (median 1.82 x 10^4 CFU, range documented)
2. Clear outcome definitions with both clinical (fever) and microbiological (bacteraemia) endpoints
3. Time-to-event data enabling incubation period analysis
4. Quantitative bacteremia data at diagnosis
5. Baseline anti-Vi serology enabling adjustment for pre-existing immunity
6. Individual-level data available in supplement

**Limitations for dose-response modeling:**
1. **Single dose level only** - cannot construct dose-response curve from this study alone
2. **Vaccinated population** - most subjects received vaccine; only n=30 in placebo arm for naive response
3. **Confounded by baseline immunity** - unexpected anti-Vi positivity complicates interpretation of naive dose-response
4. **Truncated follow-up** - 14-day limit may underestimate true attack rate

**Recommended use:**
- Combine with Waddington 2014 (dose-escalation study) and historical Maryland data for dose-response modeling
- Use placebo arm (n=30, 67% attack rate at 1.82x10^4 CFU) as one data point for dose-response curve
- Consider baseline anti-Vi stratification when modeling susceptibility
- Use time-to-event data for incubation period modeling

## Open Questions

**[OPEN]** Access to S1 Dataset (individual-level data) for detailed modeling
- Need to verify: individual challenge doses, exact times to endpoints, baseline serology values

**[OPEN]** How to handle the baseline anti-Vi imbalance in dose-response modeling
- Options: exclude Vi-positive subjects, stratify analysis, adjust statistically

**[OPEN]** Comparability with historical Maryland challenge data
- Different diagnostic methods (automated vs manual blood culture)
- Different endpoint definitions
- Different strain preparations?

**[OPEN]** What proportion of infections were subclinical (bacteremia only, no fever)?
- Table 2 shows 8/31 M01ZH09 and 11/30 placebo diagnosed by microbiological definition alone
- Important for understanding clinical vs infection endpoints
