Blood culture-PCR to optimise typhoid fever diagnosis after controlled human infection identifies frequent asymptomatic cases and evidence of primary bacteraemia. J Infect. 2017;74(4):358-366. doi:10.1016/j.jinf.2017.01.006

## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Evaluate blood culture-PCR assay for detecting S. Typhi infection vs. optimally performed blood cultures
- **Study type**: Diagnostic methods evaluation within controlled human infection model
- **Institution**: Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford
- **Population**: Healthy adults 18-60 years, typhoid-naive (same cohort as Waddington et al. 2014)
- **Registration**: Same as parent study (NCT01405521)

**[CRITICAL]** This is a secondary analysis of the Waddington et al. 2014 CHIM cohort, focused on diagnostic assay performance. **Not a new dose-response study** - all participants are the same 41 individuals from Waddington 2014.

## Subject Characteristics

### Demographics (p.359-360)
- **N total**: 41 challenged
- **Age**: 18-60 years (consenting adults)
- **Other demographics**: Not re-reported; refer to Waddington 2014 for details

### Inclusion/Exclusion
- Same as Waddington 2014: healthy, typhoid-naive adults

## Challenge Protocol

### Strain & Delivery (p.359)
- **Strain**: S. Typhi Quailes strain (wild-type)
- **Delivery**: "fresh preparation of 10^3 or 10^4 CFU of S. Typhi suspended in sodium bicarbonate solution" (p.359)
- **Buffering**: 30 mL of 0.53 g NaHCO3(aq) (Table 1, p.360)
- **Fasting**: Not re-stated; see Waddington 2014

### Dose Groups (p.360)
| Dose | N challenged |
|------|--------------|
| 10^3 CFU | 20 |
| 10^4 CFU | 21 |
| **Total** | **41** |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** The paper states participants received 10^3 or 10^4 CFU but does not break down N by dose. From Waddington 2014, 10^5 CFU group (n=5) was also included. The "41 participants" here appears to be the full cohort. Attack rates stated as "55% and 65% for each dose, respectively" (p.360) match Waddington 2014's 10^3 and 10^4 groups.

## Illness Definition (p.359)

**Typhoid Diagnosis (TD)** criteria:
1. Temperature >=38C sustained for >=12 hours, OR
2. S. Typhi bacteraemia (positive blood culture)

**Non-Typhoid Diagnosed (nTD)**: Did not meet TD criteria by day 14; all treated with antimicrobials at day 14.

**[CRITICAL]** One individual was "treated before day 14 based on symptoms alone without fulfilling the study TD criteria" - included in nTD group for analysis (p.360, Supplementary Table 1).

## Sampling Schedule (Table 1, p.360)

### All Participants
| Day | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2-14 | 28 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|------|---|
| Hour | 0 | 6 | 12 | 0 | 12 | daily | - |
| Blood culture (mL) | - | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 10 | - |
| Culture-PCR (mL) | - | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | - |

### Additional for TD Participants
Post-TD: Samples at +0, +6, +12, +24, +36, +48, +72, +96 hours
- Blood culture: 5 mL at TD+0, then 10 mL
- Culture-PCR: 5 mL at all timepoints

**Treatment**: Ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily for 14 days, initiated at TD or day 14

## Attack Rate Data (p.360)

### Primary Outcome
| Outcome | N | % |
|---------|---|---|
| Typhoid Diagnosed (TD) | 24/41 | 59% |
| Non-Typhoid Diagnosed (nTD) | 17/41 | 41% |

**By Diagnostic Criterion** (Figure 1, p.361):
- Bacteraemia with fever: 11
- Bacteraemia only (no fever): 5+5 = 10
- Fever only (no bacteraemia): 3
- Neither: 11 (nTD by definition) + 1 (early treatment) = 12

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** From Figure 1 flowchart: 21/24 TD participants had positive blood culture (87.5%); 3/24 had fever only without bacteraemia.

### By Dose (p.360)
| Dose | Attack Rate |
|------|-------------|
| 10^3 CFU | 55% |
| 10^4 CFU | 65% |

**[OPEN]** These attack rates are stated in text but N per dose is not provided in this paper. Cross-reference Waddington 2014 for denominator breakdown.

## Diagnostic Test Performance

### Blood Culture Results (p.360-361, Table 3 p.364)
- **Total positive samples**: 53/674 (7.9%)
- **Participants with >=1 positive culture**: 21/41
- **Sensitivity** (vs TD endpoint): 87.5% [95% CI: 67-97%]
- **Specificity**: 100% (by definition, as bacteraemia is part of TD)
- **NPV**: 85% [95% CI: 62-97%]

### Culture-PCR Results (p.360-361, Table 3 p.364)
- **Total positive samples**: 57/684 (8.3%)
- **Participants with >=1 positive PCR**: 23/41
- **Sensitivity** (vs TD endpoint): 70% [95% CI: 49-87%]
- **Specificity** (vs TD endpoint): 65% [95% CI: 38-86%]
- **PPV**: 74% [95% CI: 52-90%]
- **NPV**: 61% [95% CI: 36-83%]
- **Detection limit**: >=6 CFU/mL (p.360)

### Discordant Analysis (p.362, Supplementary Table 2)
- 12 mismatching pairs between culture-PCR and blood culture
- No significant difference in yield between methods (p=0.77, binomial test)

## Evidence for Asymptomatic Infection (KEY FINDING)

### Additional Culture-PCR Positive nTD Participants (p.362, Figure 1)
- **6/17 nTD participants** had >=1 positive culture-PCR result
- Of these, several had features suggesting true infection:
  - Single elevated temperature within 12h of positive PCR
  - Maximal symptom reporting on day of positive PCR
  - 1 was the participant treated early on symptoms without meeting TD

**[CRITICAL]** Authors propose attack rate may be 30/41 (73%) rather than 24/41 (59%) if culture-PCR positive nTD cases represent true infections (p.359, Abstract).

### Asymptomatic Infection Evidence Summary
| Category | N | Notes |
|----------|---|-------|
| TD by criteria | 24 | Fever and/or bacteraemia |
| nTD but PCR+ with suggestive features | 4 | Elevated temp, symptoms |
| nTD but PCR+ with minimal features | 2 | Mild symptoms only |
| nTD, PCR negative | 11 | True non-infected |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This suggests ~15% additional infection rate (6/41) beyond what standard criteria detect, consistent with subclinical/asymptomatic infection fraction.

## Evidence for Primary Bacteraemia (KEY FINDING)

### Early Positive Culture-PCR (p.361-362, Table 2 p.361)
| Timepoint | N positive samples | N participants |
|-----------|-------------------|----------------|
| 6 hours post-challenge | 1 | 1 |
| 12 hours post-challenge | 2 | 2 |
| <=48 hours post-challenge | 9 | 7 |
| <=72 hours post-challenge | 11 | 9 |

**[CRITICAL]** S. Typhi DNA detectable in blood within 48 hours after ingestion - evidence for early "primary bacteraemia" phase. "Our culture-PCR results suggest that S. Typhi DNA is detectable in blood within 48 h after ingestion" (p.364).

**Early PCR not predictive of outcome** (p.362):
- Early positive PCR did not predict subsequent TD (DOR 0.57, 95%CI 0.12-2.71, p=0.69)
- Early positive PCR did not predict bacteraemia (DOR 0.50, 95%CI 0.10-2.44, p=0.45)

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This early bacteraemia is consistent with the two-phase model: initial (primary) bacteraemia during invasion, followed by intracellular replication in reticuloendothelial system, then secondary bacteraemia with clinical illness.

## Timing of Positivity (Figure 3, p.363)

### Peak Detection Day
- Blood culture: Day 6 post-challenge
- Culture-PCR: Day 6 post-challenge

### Distribution by TD Status (Table 2, p.361)
**nTD participants (n=17)**:
- Day 0-3: 4/62 (6.5%) positive PCR
- Day 3+: 11/203 (5.4%) positive PCR
- Total: 15/265 (5.7%) positive PCR

**TD participants (n=24)**:
- Day 0-3: 5/87 (5.7%) positive PCR
- Day 3+: 37/332 (11.1%) positive PCR
- Total: 42/411 (10.2%) positive PCR

**Relative to TD** (TD participants only):
- >72h before TD: 2/57 (3.5%)
- 72 to 24h before TD: 18/44 (40.9%)
- 24h before to 24h after TD: 15/39 (38.4%)
- 24 to 72h after TD: 0/83 (0%)
- >72h after TD: 2/71 (2.8%)

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** PCR positivity peaks around time of diagnosis, with ~80% of TD positive samples occurring within 72h window centered on TD.

## Stool Shedding vs PCR (p.362)
- No significant association between early stool shedding and culture-PCR positivity (n=3/16, p=0.63, Fisher's exact)

## Baseline Immunity
- **Not reported in this paper**
- Refer to Waddington 2014 for any baseline serology
- "Small sample sizes limit interpretation" re: pre-challenge anti-Vi IgG (mentioned in Waddington 2014)

**[OPEN]** Baseline immunity data insufficient for this cohort - requires latent variable inference in dose-response model.

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Daily blood sampling with both culture and PCR
- 684 total culture-PCR samples collected
- Prospective, systematic ascertainment
- STARD-compliant diagnostic reporting (p.360)
- Individual-level data available (supplementary tables)

### Limitations
- Blood culture volume (10 mL) > culture-PCR volume (5 mL) - "This likely underestimates the performance of our culture-PCR assay" (p.365)
- PCR detection limit (>=6 CFU/mL) higher than typical bacteraemia level (median 0.5 CFU/mL in endemic settings)
- Culture-PCR uses ox-bile pre-incubation, adds complexity
- Quantitative bacterial loads reported elsewhere (Waddington 2014): median 0.47 CFU/mL at 10^3 dose, 1.10 CFU/mL at 10^4 dose

## Fit Role Assessment

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **SUPPORT** - This paper does not provide new dose-response data (same cohort as Waddington 2014). However, it provides:

1. **Asymptomatic infection estimate**: Suggests true infection rate ~73% vs. 59% by standard criteria - important for distinguishing "infection" from "fever" endpoints in dose-response model
2. **Primary bacteraemia evidence**: Supports two-phase infection model
3. **Diagnostic sensitivity context**: Documents that both blood culture (88% sens) and PCR (70% sens) miss some cases - important for interpreting historical attack rate data

**Not Core** because all dose-outcome data duplicates Waddington 2014.

## Key Extractions for Calibration

### Asymptomatic Infection Fraction (derived)
**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Based on culture-PCR positivity in nTD participants:
| Outcome | N | Rate |
|---------|---|------|
| Symptomatic infection (TD) | 24/41 | 59% |
| Probable asymptomatic infection (PCR+ nTD) | 6/17 nTD | 35% of nTD |
| Estimated total infection | 30/41 | 73% |
| Asymptomatic fraction (of infected) | 6/30 | 20% |

**[OPEN]** The 6 PCR-positive nTD cases are heterogeneous - 4 had suggestive clinical features, 2 had only mild symptoms. For modeling, consider:
- Conservative: Use 24/41 (59%) as infection rate
- Liberal: Use 30/41 (73%) as infection rate
- Bayesian: Model asymptomatic fraction with uncertainty

### Diagnostic Sensitivity Context
| Assay | Sensitivity vs TD | Specificity vs TD |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Blood culture | 88% | 100%* |
| Culture-PCR | 70% | 65% |

*By definition (bacteraemia is part of TD criteria)

**[OPEN]** These sensitivity estimates suggest historical studies using blood culture alone may underestimate true infection rates by ~10-30%.
