## Study Overview

This study evaluates two forms of immunity against typhoid fever in human volunteers:

1. **Oral vaccine-induced immunity**: Testing two killed oral antityphoid vaccine preparations (Typhoral and Taboral) at different doses
2. **Infection-induced immunity**: Testing protection conferred by prior induced typhoid infection against subsequent challenge

The study is part of the broader Maryland volunteer challenge study program conducted at the Maryland House of Correction.

## Challenge Protocol

### Challenge Strain
- **Strain**: Quailes strain of *Salmonella typhosa* (now *S. Typhi*)
- **Dose**: 100,000 (10^5) virulent organisms
- **Delivery**: Oral ingestion, administered as previously described in Hornick et al. 1967

### Timing
- Vaccine challenge studies: 8-10 weeks after vaccination
- Prior infection challenge studies: Within 12 months of initial induced infection (range: 2 months to 1 year)

### Disease Criteria (p. 668)
Criteria for initiating specific antibiotic therapy (defining clinical typhoid fever):
- Fever of 103 degrees F for over 36 hours
- Clinical signs and symptoms of typhoid fever including:
  - Abdominal pain
  - Constipation
  - Presence of rose spots
- Diagnosis confirmed by:
  - Recovery and culture of *S. typhosa* from blood and stools
  - Rising titres of typhoid agglutinins

**Important note**: Only individuals who received antibiotic treatment were considered to have typhoid disease for analysis purposes.

## Subject Characteristics

### Population
- Adult male volunteer inmates of the Maryland House of Correction
- Healthy individuals
- Informed consent obtained; volunteers free to withdraw at any time
- Study conditions adhered to Declaration of Helsinki

### Baseline Immunity
- **Vaccine studies**: Not explicitly stated, but control group attack rate of 54% at 10^5 dose suggests naive or limited prior exposure [ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]
- **Prior infection study**:
  - Previously recovered from induced typhoid fever with:
    - Positive blood cultures
    - Positive stool cultures
    - Rising serum agglutinins
  - Time since infection: 2 months to 1 year
- **Controls**: No prior typhoid exposure (for prior infection study)

---

## Outcomes and Definitions

### Primary Outcome
- **Clinical typhoid fever**: Defined as requiring antibiotic treatment based on criteria above

### Secondary Outcomes
- **Positive stool isolation**: Recovery of *S. typhosa* from stool
- **Relapse following therapy**: Recurrence of disease after initial antibiotic treatment
- **Serological response**: 4-fold rise in serum agglutinins (O, H, Vi)

## Dose-Outcome Data Tables

### Table A: Oral Vaccine Challenge Studies (Table 2, p. 669)

Challenge dose: 100,000 (10^5) virulent *S. typhosa* (Quailes strain)

| Group | N | Positive Stool Isolation | Clinical Typhoid Fever | Relapse Following Therapy |
|-------|---|-------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **6 Taboral tablets (vaccinees)** | 35 | 21 (60%) | 14 (40%) | 3 (21%) |
| **6 Taboral tablets (controls)** | 28 | 14 (50%) | 12 (43%) | 3 (25%) |
| **12 Taboral tablets (vaccinees)** | 21 | 7 (33%) | 8 (38%) | 0 |
| **12 Taboral tablets (controls)** | 24 | 15 (63%) | 13 (54%) | 2 (15%) |

**Notes**:
- 6 Taboral tablets = recommended dose (6 x 10^11 killed organisms total)
- 12 Taboral tablets = twice recommended dose (12 x 10^11 killed organisms total)
- Difference in fever frequency between 12-tablet vaccinees and controls was NOT statistically significant (p. 669)

### Table B: Prior Infection Challenge Study (Table 4, p. 670)

Challenge dose: 100,000 (10^5) virulent *S. typhosa* (Quailes strain)

| Group | N | Clinical Typhoid Fever | Relapse Following Therapy |
|-------|---|----------------------|--------------------------|
| **Prior induced typhoid fever** | 22 | 5 (23%) | 0 |
| **Controls (no prior exposure)** | 34 | 11 (30%) | 2 (18%) |

**Notes**:
- Prior infection occurred 2 months to 1 year before rechallenge (p. 668)
- Authors note this indicates immunity from prior infection is "not complete" (p. 670)
- Authors state the infecting dose was "approximately ID25-30" (p. 670) [OPEN: This appears to refer to the dose being around the ID25-30 for unvaccinated controls based on other studies, but the exact attack rate in the control group here is 30%]

### Table C: Correlation of Post-Vaccination Antibody Response with Protection (Table 3, p. 669)

| Serum Agglutinin 4-fold Rise | N | Clinical Typhoid Fever |
|-----------------------------|---|----------------------|
| O | 7 | 3 (43%) |
| H | 5 | 2 (40%) |
| Vi | 11 | 4 (36%) |
| O, H, and Vi | 2 | 1 (50%) |
| **No agglutinin rise** | 34 | 13 (38%) |

**Note**: This demonstrates antibody response did NOT correlate with protection (p. 669)

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Well-controlled challenge study with concurrent controls (p. 668)
- Clear case definition for clinical typhoid fever (p. 668)
- Bacteriological confirmation required (blood and stool cultures)
- Serological confirmation required (rising agglutinin titres)
- Consistent challenge dose (10^5 organisms) across all groups
- Same challenge strain (Quailes) used throughout

### Limitations
- Small sample sizes, leading to lack of statistical significance even with apparent differences (authors acknowledge, p. 669-670)
- Attack rate in controls varies between vaccine study arms (43% vs 54%) [OPEN: Were these truly concurrent controls or historical? The text states "52 unvaccinated volunteers" received the same challenge but Table 2 shows 28 and 24 controls for different vaccine groups]
- Prior infection group had varying time since infection (2-12 months) which may affect immunity levels
- Selection bias possible: authors note those who develop disease at low dose may represent "more susceptible individuals" (p. 670)
- Early chloramphenicol treatment may have interfered with antibody development (authors acknowledge, p. 670)

## Fit Role

**Role**: Support

**Rationale**: [ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]

This study provides valuable data on:
1. Attack rates at a single challenge dose (10^5) across multiple groups
2. Effect of prior infection on susceptibility to reinfection
3. Confirmation that antibody titers do not correlate with protection

However, for dose-response modeling, this study has limitations:
- Single challenge dose only (10^5 organisms)
- Primary focus is on vaccine efficacy rather than dose-response relationship
- Small sample sizes limit statistical power

The prior infection data (Table B) is particularly useful as it provides a measure of natural immunity following confirmed clinical infection, which can help parameterize models of immune protection.

## Open Questions

1. [OPEN] Exact timing of prior infections - was it uniformly distributed between 2-12 months, or clustered?

2. [OPEN] Were the control groups for the 6-tablet and 12-tablet vaccine studies truly independent concurrent groups, or was there overlap/historical controls? The total of 52 controls mentioned (p. 668) differs from 28+24=52 shown in Table 2, suggesting they may be the same individuals challenged at different times.

3. [OPEN] The authors state the challenge dose was "approximately ID25-30" - this appears to be based on historical data from Hornick et al. 1967 rather than the observed attack rate in this study's controls (30-54%). Clarification needed on how this relates to the dose-response curve.

4. [OPEN] What was the baseline serological status of the "no prior typhoid exposure" control group? Were they truly naive or potentially exposed to cross-reactive antigens?
