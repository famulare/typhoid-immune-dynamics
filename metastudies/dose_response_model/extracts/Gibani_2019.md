## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Effect of vaccination and prior exposure on stool shedding after controlled S. Typhi/Paratyphi challenge
- **Study type**: Pooled analysis of 6 prospective controlled human infection studies
- **Institution**: Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford
- **Population**: Healthy adults from 6 Oxford challenge studies (2011-2017)
- **Years conducted**: 2011-2017
- **Location**: Oxford, United Kingdom

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This is a secondary analysis paper pooling data across 6 Oxford CHIM studies. Primary value for dose-response modeling is: (1) aggregate sample sizes by study/vaccine, (2) shedding as infection proxy, (3) effect of prior exposure on outcomes. Does NOT report new dose-response data directly - refers to primary publications for challenge outcomes.

**Total N**: 430 participants, 4934 stool samples

## Challenge Protocol

### Strains
- **S. Typhi**: Quailes strain (genotype 3.1.0) - same as historical Maryland studies (p.1266)
- **S. Paratyphi A**: NVGH308 strain (p.1266)
- **[Note]**: Study 6 also used SB6000 (tetanus toxin-deficient mutant) strain

### Delivery (p.1266)
- **Method**: "Healthy adults drank 120 mL of sodium bicarbonate solution prior to challenge"
- **Buffering**: Yes, sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) pretreatment
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Same delivery protocol as Waddington 2014 - bicarbonate delivery

### Doses Administered
- **S. Typhi (high dose)**: 1-5 x 10^4 CFU (most studies)
- **S. Typhi (low dose)**: 1-5 x 10^3 CFU (Study 1 only)
- **S. Paratyphi (high dose)**: 1-5 x 10^3 CFU
- **S. Paratyphi (low dose)**: 0.5-1 x 10^3 CFU (Study 3 only)

**[OPEN]** Dose ranges reported as "1-5 x 10^n" - unclear if this is target range, actual variation, or measurement uncertainty. Primary papers should be consulted for exact dosing.

## Subject Characteristics

### Sample Sizes by Study (Table 2, p.1267)
| Study | N Participants | N with >=1 positive stool | Median days shedding [IQR] |
|-------|----------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| T1 | 40 | 22 (55%) | 1 [0-2] |
| T2 | 92 | 72 (78%) | 2 [1-4] |
| P1 | 40 | 17 (43%) | 0 [0-1] |
| VAST | 103 | 64 (62%) | 1 [0-2] |
| PATCH | 115 | 56 (45%) | 0 [0-2] |
| TYGER | 40 | 24 (60%) | 1 [0-2] |
| **Total** | **430** | **255 (59%)** | |

### Demographics (p.1269)
- **Sex**: 34% female among 197 unvaccinated participants
- **Age**: Not significantly related to shedding (P = .795)
- **Geography**: UK adults (non-endemic country)

### Exclusion Criteria (from primary studies)
- Prior typhoid vaccination or infection (varies by study design)
- Standard CHIM exclusions (see primary papers)

## Vaccines Tested

### Study 2 (T2) - NCT01405521
- M01ZH09 (experimental oral vaccine): n = 31 vaccinated + challenged
- Ty21a (live oral, 3 doses): n = 30 vaccinated + challenged
- Placebo: n = 30

### Study 4 (VAST) - NCT02324751
- Vi-PS (Typhim Vi, Sanofi Pasteur): n = 35 vaccinated + challenged
- Vi-TT conjugate (TypbarTCV, Bharat Biotech): n = 37 vaccinated + challenged
- Control (MenACWY): n = 31

## Baseline Immunity

### Anti-Vi IgG (p.1269, Figure 3A)
- Measured pre-challenge using commercial ELISA (VaccZyme, The Binding Site)
- **Higher anti-Vi IgG associated with less shedding** (P < .0001)
- Units: EU/mL
- Range shown in Figure 3A: approximately 10 to 5000 EU/mL

### Other Serology (p.1267, p.1269)
- Anti-LPS IgG (S. Typhi lipopolysaccharide): No relationship with shedding (P = .182)
- Anti-Hd IgG (S. Typhi flagellin): No relationship with shedding (P = .873)
- Anti-O:2 IgG (S. Paratyphi A): No relationship with S. Paratyphi shedding (P = .810)
- IgA and IgM responses: Nonsignificant (Supplementary Figure S2)

**[OPEN]** Individual-level baseline serology data would be needed to use as CoP predictor. Only aggregate analysis reported here.

## Outcome Definitions

### Enteric Fever Diagnosis (p.1266)
- **Temperature criterion**: Fever of 38C for >=12 hours
- **AND/OR Bacteremia criterion**: S. (Para)Typhi bacteremia detected >=72 hours from challenge
- **Treatment trigger**: Antibiotics initiated at diagnosis or at day 14 for undiagnosed

### Stool Shedding (Primary Outcome of This Paper)
- **Method**: Daily stool cultures for 14 days post-challenge
- **Laboratory**: Oxford University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, standard national protocols (p.1266)
- **Definition**: Positive stool culture for S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi

## Dose-Outcome Data

### Overall Stool Shedding by Challenge Agent (Table 2, p.1267)

| Challenge Agent | N Samples | N Positive | % Positive |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|------------|
| S. Typhi | 3698 | 537 | 14.5% |
| S. Paratyphi A | 1236 | 93 | 7.5% |
| **Total** | **4934** | **630** | **12.8%** |

### Shedding by Participants (Table 2, p.1267)
- 255/430 (59%) participants had at least one positive stool sample

### Typhoid Diagnosis Rate (p.1267)
- **S. Typhi challenged**: 186/331 (56.2%) met diagnostic criteria for typhoid fever

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** The 56.2% attack rate for S. Typhi is pooled across doses (mainly 10^4) and includes both vaccinated and unvaccinated. Not directly usable for naive dose-response without stratification from primary papers.

### Shedding by Vaccine Group - S. Typhi (p.1268-1269, Figure 1C)

Participants challenged with 1-5 x 10^4 CFU S. Typhi wild-type:

| Group | N | Shedding OR vs Control | 95% CI | P-value |
|-------|---|------------------------|--------|---------|
| Control/unvaccinated | 158 | Reference | - | - |
| Vi-PS | 35 | 0.34 | 0.15-0.77 | .010 |
| Vi-TT | 37 | 0.41 | 0.19-0.91 | .029 |
| Ty21a | 30 | 0.57 | 0.27-1.20 | .140 |
| M01ZH09 | 32 | NS | - | NS |

**[CRITICAL]** Vi vaccines significantly reduce stool shedding - suggests vaccine effect on infection, not just disease severity.

### Shedding by Diagnosis Status (p.1267, Figure 1A)

N = 331 S. Typhi challenged participants:
- **Diagnosed**: n = 186
- **Non-diagnosed**: n = 145

Odds of shedding in diagnosed vs non-diagnosed (p.1267):
| Day post-challenge | OR | 95% CI | P-value |
|--------------------|-----|--------|---------|
| Day 1 | 2.49 | 1.32-4.69 | .0049 |
| Day 2 | 8.93 | 3.86-20.61 | <.0001 |
| Day 3 | 22.59 | 6.83-74.7 | <.0001 |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Early shedding strongly predictive of subsequent typhoid diagnosis.

### Effect of Prior Exposure (p.1269, Figure 2, Supplementary Table S1)

| Comparison | OR | 95% CI | P-value |
|------------|-----|--------|---------|
| T-T vs T (Typhi rechallenge vs naive) | 0.33 | 0.1-0.8 | .016 |
| P-T vs T-T (Paratyphi-primed then Typhi vs Typhi-primed) | 7.5 | 2.0-28.4 | .003 |
| P-T vs T (Paratyphi-primed then Typhi vs naive) | 2.5 | 0.8-8.0 | .125 |

Sample sizes for rechallenge groups (Figure 2 legend, p.1269):
- T (S. Typhi naive): n = 71
- T-T (S. Typhi rechallenge): n = 27
- P (S. Paratyphi naive): n = 39
- P-P (S. Paratyphi rechallenge): n = 13
- P-T (S. Typhi after prior S. Paratyphi): n = 10
- T-P (S. Paratyphi after prior S. Typhi): n = 27

**[CRITICAL]** Prior homotypic exposure (T-T) reduces shedding by ~67% (OR 0.33). Heterotypic priming (P-T) may INCREASE shedding risk - concerning for cross-immunity assumptions.

### S. Typhi vs S. Paratyphi Shedding (p.1268)

Unvaccinated participants only:
- S. Typhi challenged: n = 197
- S. Paratyphi challenged: n = 109
- **OR for shedding (Typhi vs Paratyphi)**: 1.97 (95% CI 1.00-3.88, P = .049)
- Dose was nonsignificant in model

**[OPEN]** Higher S. Typhi shedding may reflect higher challenge dose (10^4 vs 10^3) or true serovar differences. Cannot distinguish without dose-matched comparison.

### Sex Differences (p.1269)
- Men had higher shedding than women: OR 1.78 (95% CI 1.10-2.87, P = .0187)
- Median samples: Women 11 [IQR 8-14], Men 12 [IQR 9-15]

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Large pooled dataset (n = 430, 4934 samples)
- Standardized stool culture protocols across studies
- Daily sampling for 14 days - high temporal resolution
- Mixed effects models account for repeated measures
- Includes both vaccination and natural immunity effects

### Limitations
- **Pooled analysis**: Study-level heterogeneity adjusted for but not eliminated
- **Different doses across studies**: Most S. Typhi at 10^4, some at 10^3; S. Paratyphi at 10^3
- **Shedding as proxy**: Stool shedding not same as clinical infection/fever
- **Non-endemic population**: UK adults may not represent endemic immunity patterns
- **Antibiotics truncate shedding**: Treatment at diagnosis or day 14 censors natural shedding duration
- **Single strain per serovar**: Quailes (S. Typhi) and NVGH308 (S. Paratyphi) - not contemporary endemic strains

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Cohort overlap with other extracts: This paper reanalyzes participants from Waddington 2014, Darton 2016, and Jin 2017. Should NOT double-count when pooling dose-response data.

## Fit Role Assessment

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **Support** - This paper does not provide novel dose-response data but offers:
1. Aggregate sample sizes and attack rates confirmatory of primary papers
2. Evidence that stool shedding can serve as infection proxy (precedes clinical diagnosis)
3. Vaccine effects on shedding (infection prevention, not just severity reduction)
4. Prior exposure effects critical for immunity modeling
5. Anti-Vi IgG as correlate of protection for shedding

For dose-response calibration, extract data from primary papers (Waddington 2014, Darton 2016, Jin 2017). Use this paper for:
- Validating stool shedding as infection proxy
- Informing immunity effects in dose-response model
- Understanding rechallenge/cross-immunity dynamics

## Key Extractions for Modeling

### Shedding as Infection Proxy
- 59% of participants shed S. Typhi/Paratyphi
- 56.2% met typhoid diagnosis criteria (S. Typhi)
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Shedding slightly exceeds clinical diagnosis rate, consistent with subclinical infection

### Immunity Effects (for CoP modeling)
| Factor | Effect on Shedding | Magnitude |
|--------|-------------------|-----------|
| Anti-Vi IgG (log increase) | Protective | P < .0001 |
| Vi-PS vaccination | Protective | OR 0.34 |
| Vi-TT vaccination | Protective | OR 0.41 |
| Prior S. Typhi exposure | Protective | OR 0.33 |
| Prior S. Paratyphi (heterotypic) | Harmful for S. Typhi | OR 2.5-7.5 |

### Vaccine Efficacy Against Shedding
If shedding reduction approximates infection prevention:
- **Vi-PS**: ~66% reduction (1 - 0.34)
- **Vi-TT**: ~59% reduction (1 - 0.41)

**[OPEN]** These estimates are averaged over 14 days. Pattern of shedding over time was similar across vaccines (non-significant day-by-vaccine interaction), suggesting vaccines reduce probability of any shedding rather than duration.
