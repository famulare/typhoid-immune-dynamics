**Trial Registration**: NCT02192008

## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Does prior S. Typhi or S. Paratyphi A exposure confer protection against subsequent homologous or heterologous challenge?
- **Study type**: Participant-blinded, randomised, outpatient human challenge/re-challenge study (PATCH study)
- **Institution**: Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Oxford
- **Location**: Centre for Clinical Vaccinology & Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK
- **Population**: Healthy adults 18-60 years; naive controls + previously challenged volunteers
- **Conducted**: March 2015 - August 2017 (p.6)

**[CRITICAL]** This is a re-challenge study examining infection-derived immunity. Key for understanding how prior exposure affects dose-response. Not a simple dose-finding study - primary focus is comparing attack rates between naive and previously-exposed individuals.

## Challenge Protocol

### Strains (p.4)
- **S. Typhi**: Quailes strain (same as all Oxford and Maryland studies)
- **S. Paratyphi A**: NVGH308 strain (recent clinical isolate)

### Doses (Table 2, p.9)
- **S. Typhi**: 1-5 x 10^4 CFU
  - Actual median dose: 22.9-26.2 x 10^3 CFU (IQR varies by arm)
- **S. Paratyphi A**: 1-5 x 10^3 CFU
  - Actual median dose: 2.1-2.6 x 10^3 CFU (IQR varies by arm)

### Delivery Method (p.4)
- **Pre-challenge**: Sodium bicarbonate solution (2.1g/120mL) ingested 2 minutes prior
- **Challenge inoculum**: Suspended in sodium bicarbonate solution (0.53g/30mL)
- **Administration**: Kept on ice, administered within 2 hours of preparation
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Same bicarbonate delivery as Waddington 2014 - comparable effective dose scaling

### Fasting
- Not explicitly stated in this paper; assumed consistent with Oxford CHIM protocol (90 min)

## Subject Characteristics

### Demographics (Table 1, p.7)
| Group | N | Male | Median Age (range) |
|-------|---|------|-------------------|
| ST Naive | 19 | 74% | 27.2 (19.6-59.7) |
| ST-ST Re-challenge | 27 | 59% | 33.2 (21.3-60.8) |
| SPT-ST Re-challenge | 10 | 90% | 26.7 (22.2-52) |
| SPT Naive | 18 | 61% | 27.1 (18.8-42.6) |
| SPT-SPT Re-challenge | 12 | 50% | 23.8 (21-44.1) |
| ST-SPT Re-challenge | 26 | 58% | 32.0 (19.3-55) |

**Total N**: 112 in per-protocol analysis (124 enrolled, 9 withdrew, 3 excluded for early antibiotics)

### Ethnicity (Table 1)
- White British: 73% overall
- White (Other): 21%
- Mixed: 5%
- Asian (Indian): 1%

### Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (p.4, S1 Methods)
**Inclusion**:
- Healthy adults 18-60 years
- No prior residency >=6 months in enteric fever endemic country

**Exclusion**:
- Known typhoid vaccination (Vi-polysaccharide or Ty21a) - for naive cohort only
- Significant medical/surgical/psychiatric history
- Gallbladder disease
- High-risk occupations

**[CRITICAL]** Re-challenge cohort heterogeneous:
- Some had prior typhoid vaccination in earlier vaccine efficacy studies
- Some developed disease on first challenge, some did not
- Varying intervals since primary challenge (12-68 months)

## Baseline Immunity

### Prior Typhoid Vaccination Status (Table 1, p.7)
Re-challenge participants only (naive excluded if vaccinated):
| Group | Any Vaccine | Vi-PS | Vi-TT | Ty21a | M01ZH09 |
|-------|-------------|-------|-------|-------|---------|
| ST-ST | 11/27 (41%) | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 |
| SPT-ST | 0/10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| SPT-SPT | 0/12 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| ST-SPT | 15/26 (58%) | 3 | 8 | 1 | 3 |

### Prior Challenge History (Table 1, p.7)
**Primary Challenge Doses**:
- S. Typhi re-challenge arms: 89-92% received 1-5x10^4 CFU; 8-11% received 1-5x10^3 CFU
- S. Paratyphi re-challenge arms: 40-50% received 1-5x10^3 CFU; 50-60% received 0.5-1x10^3 CFU

**Prior Enteric Fever Diagnosis** (on first challenge):
| Group | N with prior diagnosis | % |
|-------|------------------------|---|
| ST-ST Re-challenge | 12/27 | 44% |
| SPT-ST Re-challenge | 7/10 | 70% |
| SPT-SPT Re-challenge | 5/12 | 41% |
| ST-SPT Re-challenge | 13/26 | 50% |

**Re-challenge Interval** (Table 1):
- ST previously challenged: Median 38 months (range 12-68)
- SPT previously challenged: Median 17 months (range 14-27)

### Baseline Serology (p.13, S10-S11 Figs)
- Anti-O9:LPS IgG, anti-Hd IgG, anti-Vi IgG measured for S. Typhi challenge
- Anti-O2:LPS IgG, IgA measured for S. Paratyphi challenge
- "Baseline antibody levels to O-, H- and Vi-antigens were comparable between naive and re-challenge participants, and did not differ between those who went on to develop disease compared with those who did not"

**[OPEN]** Despite prior challenge/vaccination, baseline serology did not predict protection. This is a key finding for CoP modeling - suggests antibody titers may not be the relevant CoP.

## Illness Definition (p.5)

**Composite Diagnostic Endpoint for Enteric Fever**:
1. Temperature >=38C persisting for >=12 hours, AND/OR
2. S. Typhi/Paratyphi bacteremia (positive blood culture >=72 hours post-challenge)

**[CRITICAL]** Same definition as Waddington 2014 and other Oxford studies. Different from Maryland strict (103F/39.4C) definition.

### Ascertainment Schedule (p.4-5)
- Participants reviewed 12 hours after challenge, then daily for minimum 14 days
- Blood cultures collected at 12h post-challenge and daily until 96h post-treatment
- Twice daily temperature self-recording for 21 days via electronic diary
- Stool cultures collected per protocol (schedule in S1 Methods)

## Treatment Protocol (p.5)
- **Trigger**: Meeting composite diagnostic endpoint, or Day 14 (for non-diagnosed)
- **Regimen (March 2015 - October 2016)**: Azithromycin 500mg once daily x 14 days
- **Regimen (After October 2016)**: Ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily x 14 days
- Change prompted by data safety monitoring committee recommendation

## Primary Outcome Data - Attack Rates (Table 2, p.9)

### S. Typhi Challenge Arms

| Group | N | N Diagnosed | Attack Rate | 95% CI |
|-------|---|-------------|-------------|--------|
| ST Naive | 19 | 12 | 63% | 38-84% |
| ST-ST Re-challenge (homologous) | 27 | 12 | 44% | 25-65% |
| SPT-ST Re-challenge (heterologous) | 10 | 7 | 70% | 35-93% |

**Homologous Protection (ST-ST vs ST Naive)**:
- RR 0.70 (95% CI 0.41-1.21), p=0.24
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** ~30% relative risk reduction, not statistically significant

**Heterologous Protection (SPT-ST vs ST Naive)**:
- RR 1.11 (95% CI 0.65-1.89), p=0.99
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** No cross-protection from prior S. Paratyphi

### S. Paratyphi A Challenge Arms

| Group | N | N Diagnosed | Attack Rate | 95% CI |
|-------|---|-------------|-------------|--------|
| SPT Naive | 18 | 10 | 56% | 31-78% |
| SPT-SPT Re-challenge (homologous) | 12 | 3 | 25% | 5-57% |
| ST-SPT Re-challenge (heterologous) | 26 | 13 | 50% | 30-70% |

**Homologous Protection (SPT-SPT vs SPT Naive)**:
- RR 0.45 (95% CI 0.16-1.30), p=0.14
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** ~55% relative risk reduction, not statistically significant (small N)

**Heterologous Protection (ST-SPT vs SPT Naive)**:
- RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.51-1.58), p=0.77
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** No cross-protection from prior S. Typhi

## Post-Hoc Analysis - Historical Controls (p.9-10)

### S. Typhi (compared to pooled naive from all Oxford studies 2011-2018, n=121)
- Historical naive attack rate: 84/121 (69%, 95% CI 60-77%)
- ST-ST re-challenge: 12/27 (44%)
- RR 0.64 (95% CI 0.41-0.99), p=0.02
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** 36% relative risk reduction, statistically significant with larger control group

### S. Paratyphi A (compared to pooled naive, n=39)
- Historical naive attack rate: 22/38 (58%)
- SPT-SPT re-challenge: 3/12 (25%)
- RR 0.43 (95% CI 0.15-1.19), p=0.1
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** 57% relative risk reduction, not significant

## Effect of Prior Disease on Re-challenge Outcome (Table 3, p.13)

**[CRITICAL]** Individuals who did NOT develop disease on first challenge were more protected on re-challenge:

| Group | No Prior Disease | Prior Disease | RR | p |
|-------|------------------|---------------|-----|---|
| All re-challenge | 10/38 (26%) | 25/37 (68%) | 0.38 (0.22-0.69) | 0.0005 |
| ST-ST | 4/15 (27%) | 8/12 (67%) | 0.40 (0.16-1.01) | 0.06 |
| ST-ST (no prior vaccine) | 2/9 (22%) | 5/7 (71%) | 0.31 (0.08-1.15) | 0.13 |
| SPT-ST | 1/3 (33%) | 6/7 (86%) | 0.39 (0.08-1.98) | 0.18 |
| SPT-SPT | 2/7 (29%) | 1/5 (20%) | 1.43 (0.17-11.76) | 0.99 |
| ST-SPT | 3/13 (23%) | 10/13 (77%) | 0.30 (0.11-0.85) | 0.02 |

**[CRITICAL]** This suggests host susceptibility factors (possibly innate immunity or trained immunity) rather than classical adaptive memory explains protection. Multivariable model (Table 4, p.13) confirmed prior diagnosis status independently predicted re-challenge outcome (adjusted RR 2.09, p=0.0048).

## Secondary Outcomes

### Mode of Diagnosis (Table 2, p.9)
| Challenge | N diagnosed | Bacteremia only | Fever only | Both |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|------------|------|
| S. Typhi total | 31 | 16 | 2 | 13 |
| S. Paratyphi total | 26 | 15 | 2 | 9 |

~97% (S. Typhi) and ~93% (S. Paratyphi) of diagnosed had bacteremia confirmed

### Time to Diagnosis (Table 2, p.9)

| Group | Median (range) days |
|-------|---------------------|
| ST Naive | 6.2 (5.0-10.1) |
| ST-ST Re-challenge | 8.0 (4.0-10.9) |
| SPT-ST Re-challenge | 7.0 (4.0-8.9) |
| SPT Naive | 6.4 (4.3-12.1) |
| SPT-SPT Re-challenge | 9.4 (6.0-11.0) |
| ST-SPT Re-challenge | 8.0 (5.1-14.2) |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Homologous re-challenge associated with prolonged incubation (p=0.08 for ST, p=0.09 for SPT), suggesting partial immunity delays but doesn't prevent disease

### Duration of Bacteremia (Table 2, p.9)
| Group | Median hours (IQR) |
|-------|-------------------|
| ST Naive | 24.5 (4.49-76.3) |
| ST-ST Re-challenge | 24 (15.1-68.4) |
| SPT Naive | 93.7 (67.5-96) |
| SPT-SPT Re-challenge | 72.8 (49.5-96) |

### Quantitative Blood Culture (Table 2, p.9)
All groups: Median 0-1.2 CFU/mL (low bacterial loads)

### Stool Shedding (p.12, S7 Fig)
- Diagnosed participants more likely to have positive stool: 36/58 (62%) vs 18/75 (24%), RR 2.59, p<0.0001

## Symptom Profiles (p.10-12, Fig 2)

Most common symptoms in diagnosed participants:
- Headache: 97%
- Malaise: 90%
- Anorexia: 78%
- Myalgia: 78%

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** No significant difference in symptom severity between naive and re-challenge groups - prior exposure did not attenuate clinical phenotype in those who developed disease.

## Severe Enteric Fever (Table 2, p.9)

Pre-specified criteria for severe disease (any of):
- Systolic BP <=85 mmHg: 0 cases
- Oral temperature >=40C: 0 cases
- Significant lethargy/confusion: 0 cases
- GI bleeding/perforation: 0 cases
- Grade 4 laboratory abnormality: 5 cases (all hypokalaemia, attributed to pseudohypokalaemia)

| Group | N with severe criteria |
|-------|------------------------|
| ST Naive | 2/12 (17%) |
| ST-ST Re-challenge | 0/12 (0%) |
| SPT-ST Re-challenge | 1/7 (14%) |
| SPT Naive | 0/10 (0%) |
| SPT-SPT Re-challenge | 0/3 (0%) |
| ST-SPT Re-challenge | 2/13 (15%) |

## Serology Results (Fig 3, p.14-15)

### Anti-O IgG Response
- Participants who developed disease showed significant rises in anti-O9:LPS (S. Typhi) and anti-O2:LPS (S. Paratyphi) IgG
- Those without disease showed no significant antibody response
- No significant difference in fold-change between naive and re-challenge groups

**[OPEN]** No demonstrable antibody booster effect on re-challenge - antibody response magnitude similar to primary response in those who developed disease.

### Anti-Vi IgG
- S. Typhi challenge not associated with significant anti-Vi or anti-Hd IgG response (S12 Fig)

## Safety (p.6-8)

- All participants successfully treated
- No disease relapse/recrudescence at 12 months
- One convalescent shedding case (resolved with azithromycin after ciprofloxacin failure)
- 4 serious adverse events (2 considered challenge-related)

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Randomised, participant-blinded design
- Systematic modern CHIM protocol
- Both homologous and heterologous re-challenge arms
- Detailed individual-level data
- Multiple timepoint serology
- Long follow-up (12 months)
- Multivariable analysis accounting for confounders

### Limitations
- **Small sample sizes** in each subgroup - study underpowered for primary comparisons
- **Heterogeneous re-challenge cohort**:
  - Variable prior vaccination (0-58% by arm)
  - Variable prior disease (41-70%)
  - Variable re-challenge interval (12-68 months)
- **No formal sample size calculation** - constrained by available re-challenge volunteers
- **Different serovars use different doses**: S. Typhi 10^4 vs S. Paratyphi 10^3
- **Early antibiotic treatment** limits natural history conclusions

## Fit Role Assessment

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **SUPPORT** for dose-response modeling

### Rationale
1. **Not a dose-finding study** - single dose per serovar (10^4 S. Typhi, 10^3 S. Paratyphi)
2. **Primary value is immunity effect data**:
   - Quantifies protection from prior exposure (~36% for S. Typhi, ~55% for S. Paratyphi)
   - Shows heterogeneous susceptibility independent of adaptive immunity
   - No evidence for cross-protection between serovars
3. **Provides naive attack rates** at these doses consistent with other Oxford studies:
   - S. Typhi 10^4: 63% (matches pooled historical 69%)
   - S. Paratyphi 10^3: 56% (matches prior studies)
4. **Complex confounding** from prior vaccination makes immunity effects hard to disentangle

### Data Usable for Calibration
**Naive arms only** (single dose point each):
| Serovar | Dose | N | N diagnosed | Attack Rate |
|---------|------|---|-------------|-------------|
| S. Typhi | ~2.5x10^4 CFU | 19 | 12 | 63% |
| S. Paratyphi A | ~2.5x10^3 CFU | 18 | 10 | 56% |

**[OPEN]** Re-challenge arm data could inform immunity scaling parameter (gamma) but requires careful handling of:
- Prior vaccination status (confounded with prior challenge)
- Time since primary challenge
- Whether developed disease on primary challenge (different susceptibility)

## Key Extractions for Calibration

### Primary dose-response (naive only, composite fever OR bacteremia):
| Serovar | Dose (CFU) | N | N diagnosed | Attack Rate |
|---------|------------|---|-------------|-------------|
| S. Typhi | 1-5 x 10^4 | 19 | 12 | 63% |
| S. Paratyphi A | 1-5 x 10^3 | 18 | 10 | 56% |

### Bacteremia endpoint (from Table 2 denominators):
| Serovar | Dose | N | N bacteremic | Rate |
|---------|------|---|--------------|------|
| S. Typhi naive | 10^4 | 19 | 12 | 63% |
| S. Paratyphi naive | 10^3 | 18 | 9 | 50% |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Use naive arm data to validate/supplement Oxford dose-response curve at single dose points. Re-challenge arm data valuable for understanding immunity but too confounded for straightforward inclusion in dose-response calibration without explicit immunity modeling.

## Summary Statistics for Meta-Analysis

### Homologous Protection Effect (relative risk reduction)
| Serovar | RR | 95% CI | Point estimate |
|---------|-----|--------|----------------|
| S. Typhi | 0.64 | 0.41-0.99 | 36% RRR |
| S. Paratyphi | 0.43 | 0.15-1.19 | 57% RRR |

### Key Finding: Host Susceptibility
Prior disease on first challenge strongly predicted re-challenge outcome independent of:
- Time since challenge
- Challenge agent
- Prior vaccination
- Age, sex

This suggests innate susceptibility factors dominate over adaptive immunity in this model.
