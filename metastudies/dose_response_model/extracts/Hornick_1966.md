## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Evaluate typhoid vaccine effectiveness using human challenge model
- **Study type**: Controlled human infection model (CHIM) with vaccine efficacy component
- **Institution**: University of Maryland School of Medicine
- **Funding**: U.S. Army Commission of Epidemiological Survey, Armed Forces Epidemiological Board; NIH Grant #TW00142

## Challenge Protocol

### Strain
- **Name**: Quailes strain of *Salmonella typhosa*
- **Origin**: Obtained from chronic carrier admitted to University of Maryland Hospital following cholecystectomy for calculi
- **Characterization**: "Fully characterized and is pathogenic for man" (p.362)
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This is the same strain used across all Maryland studies

### Dose Preparation & Delivery
- **Medium**: Skimmed milk
- **Storage**: -70°C (frozen milk specimens served as source for each challenge inoculum)
- **Verification**: "Bacteria were transferred twice in liquid and solid media to insure uniformity of the challenge suspension. The number of typhoid bacilli used for challenge was estimated and 1.0 cc aliquots were placed in 30 cc of milk. Subsequent plate counts verified the anticipated number of organisms in each inocula." (p.362)
- **Administration**: "Each volunteer gargled and then swallowed this contaminated inoculum" (p.362)
- **Volume**: 30 cc milk total
- **Buffering**: Not mentioned - **[OPEN]** Was any buffering used?
- **Fasting**: Not explicitly stated

### Dose Measurement Basis
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Doses are plated CFU counts, verified after preparation

## Subject Characteristics

### Demographics
- **Location**: Maryland House of Correction, Jessup, Maryland
- **Population**: Adult male inmates
- **Health status**: "Healthy" (stated but not defined)
- **Age**: Not reported
- **N total**: Varies by experiment; Figure 2 shows cumulative N=213 across all dose groups

### Recruitment/Selection
- **Consent**: "Volunteers were well informed, healthy adult inmates" (p.362)
- **[OPEN]** Exclusion criteria not explicitly stated - were subjects with prior typhoid excluded?

## Baseline Immunity

### Prior Typhoid History
- **[OPEN]** Not explicitly stated whether subjects had prior typhoid
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Likely excluded subjects with known prior typhoid, but not documented

### Baseline Serology
- **Not reported** for pre-challenge
- Post-challenge agglutinins mentioned: "There was no correlation between resistance to disease and the presence of high titers of circulating agglutinins to O and H antigens" (p.366)

### Vaccination Status
- Control (unvaccinated) groups included
- Vaccine groups received K (acetone-killed) or L (heat-killed phenol) vaccines
- Vaccine timing: "Three doses of these vaccines; the first two doses a week apart and the third one month after the second injection. Challenge with viable bacteria was performed three to eighteen months later." (p.365)

## Outcomes

### Fever/Disease Definition
- **Definition**: "Chloramphenicol therapy was started when the temperature exceeded 103 degrees F for over 24 to 36 hours. Usually this was the third febrile day and the expected clinical manifestations of typhoid fever were present." (p.362)
- **[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Disease = temperature ≥103°F sustained for 24-36 hours + clinical manifestations
- **Treatment trigger**: Temperature >103°F for 24-36 hours + clinical manifestations → chloramphenicol

### Ascertainment
- **Blood cultures**: "Specimens of blood for culture were usually obtained daily from the fourth through the tenth postchallenge day" (p.362)
- **Stool cultures**: "All stools were cultured" (p.362)
- **Monitoring period**: Through at least day 10; treatment day varies

### Infection Definition
- **[OPEN]** Paper uses "ill" and "disease" - appears to mean clinical typhoid fever requiring treatment, not subclinical infection
- Blood culture positivity noted separately from "disease" outcome

## Dose-Outcome Data

### Figure 2: Dose Response in Induced Typhoid Fever (p.364)
**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** These appear to be cumulative totals across multiple experiments in unvaccinated/control subjects

| Dose (organisms) | N challenged | N ill | Attack rate |
|------------------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| 10^9 (1 billion) | 42 | 40 | 95.2% |
| 10^8 (100 million) | 9 | 8 | 88.9% |
| 10^7 (10 million) | 32 | 16 | 50.0% |
| 10^5 (100,000) | 116 | 32 | 27.6% |
| 10^3 (1,000) | 14 | 9 | 64.3% |

**[OPEN]** The 10^3 result (64.3%) is anomalously high - higher than 10^5 (27.6%). Small N (14) may explain variance, or these may be a different population. Text states "At the upper end of the range, the attack rate was almost 100 per cent" and "Following ingestion of 7 logs or 10 million organisms, the attack rate was 50 per cent." This matches 10^9 and 10^7 data.

**Key reference values from text (p.364)**:
- ID50 = 10^7 = 10 million organisms
- ID25 = ~10^5 = 100,000 organisms

### Figure 3: Vaccine Efficacy Data (p.365)
Challenge dose 10^5 (ID25 dose used for vaccine trials):

| Group | N challenged | N ill | Attack rate |
|-------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Vaccine K (acetone) | 43 | 4 | 9.3% |
| Vaccine L (phenol) | 45 | 3 | 6.7% |
| Placebo | 104 | 28 | 26.9% |

At 10^7 dose:
| Group | N challenged | N ill | Attack rate |
|-------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Vaccine K | ~28 | 12 | ~43% |
| Vaccine L | ~24 | ~13 | ~54% |
| Placebo | ~30 | ~15 | ~50% |

At 10^9 dose:
| Group | N challenged | N ill | Attack rate |
|-------|--------------|-------|-------------|
| Vaccine K | ~4 | 4 | ~100% |
| Vaccine L | ~4 | 3-4 | ~75-100% |
| Placebo | 4 | 4 | 100% |

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Multi-dose design spanning 6 orders of magnitude (10^3 to 10^9)
- Dose verification via plate counts
- Standardized strain (Quailes)
- Standardized delivery (milk)

### Limitations
- Pre-challenge immunity not characterized
- Age/detailed demographics not reported
- 10^3 dose result anomalous
- Some Figure 3 values estimated from bar chart

## Cross-References
- This is Part I of the Maryland typhoid studies series
- Data likely overlap with Hornick 1967, Hornick & Snyder 1970, other Hornick papers
- Same Quailes strain used in subsequent Maryland studies

## Fit Role Assessment
**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **CORE** - Multi-dose study with dose-response curve; foundational for N50 and α estimation
