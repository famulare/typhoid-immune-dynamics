## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Evaluate typhoid vaccine effectiveness via volunteer studies and comparison with WHO field trials
- **Study type**: Summary of Maryland CHIM studies + WHO field trial comparison
- **Institution**: University of Maryland School of Medicine

## Key Data - Dose Response (Table 1, p.618)

**CRITICAL: This table clarifies the 10^3 dose data**

| Dose (organisms) | N challenged | N with disease | Attack rate |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 10^9 | 42 | 40 | 95% |
| 10^8 | 9 | 8 | 89% |
| 10^7 | 32 | 16 | 50% |
| 10^5 | 116 | 32 | 28% |
| 10^3 | 14 | 0 | 0% |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This clarifies that at 10^3 dose, NO disease occurred (0/14), resolving ambiguity from Figure 2 in 1966 paper.

### Disease Definition
"These rates were determined in those volunteers with disease, which is defined as illness associated with oral temperature of 103°F or greater for over 36 to 48 hours. Specific treatment was then initiated." (p.618)

### Key Observations (p.618)
- ID25 = 10^5 (100,000 organisms)
- ID50 = 10^7 (10,000,000 organisms)
- "Once illness occurred, the clinical courses were identical, regardless of the dose of the infectious inoculum"
- "Only the incubation period varied with size of the infecting dose. There was inverse correlation: longer incubation periods occurred with the smaller doses."

## Antibiotic Pre-treatment Effect (p.618)
- "Volunteers pretreated with oral neomycin or streptomycin were infected with 1000 S. typhosa, whereas no infection occurred without antibiotic administration"
- **[OPEN]** This suggests gut flora disruption dramatically lowers ID - important for model interpretation

## Immunity Data (p.619)

### Lack of Antibody Correlation
"There was no correlation in control subjects (nonvaccinated) between the prechallenge titers of O, H, and Vi antibodies and the subsequent clinical course."

Specific data at ID25 (10^5) challenge:
- "36 to 56 men without O antibodies failed to become ill"
- "Nineteen of 38 men with negative H titers failed to manifest disease"
- "Only three of 15 with negative Vi antibody titers developed typhoid fever"

**[OPEN]** These immunity-outcome associations need careful extraction for modeling

## Vaccine Efficacy Data (Table 4, p.621)

| Vaccine | 10^9 | 10^7 | 10^5 |
|---------|------|------|------|
| K | 2/3 | 12/28 (43%) | 4/43 (9%) |
| L | 3/4 | 13/24 (54%) | 3/45 (7%) |
| Vi | 6/7 | 10/14 (71%) | 2/13 (15%) |
| Control | 4/4 | 15/30 (50%) | 28/104 (27%) |

**Vaccine Effectiveness at ID25**: "67 per cent (based on 27 per cent attack rate in the control group at this challenge level versus 9 per cent in vaccinees)" (p.621)

## WHO Field Trial Data (Table 2, p.620)

(Same data as in 1970 review - see Hornick_Snyder_1970.md)

## Cross-References
- Data overlap with Hornick 1966, Hornick "Appraisal", Hornick & Snyder 1970
- Table 1 numbers match across papers
- WHO field trial data from Cvjetanovic & Uemura references

## Fit Role Assessment
**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **SUPPORT** - Overlaps with other Hornick papers; useful for cross-checking Table 1 dose-response data (especially 10^3 = 0/14)
