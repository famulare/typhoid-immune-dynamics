**Note**: Presented at 79th Meeting, November 1966; published 1967

## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Appraise typhoid vaccine efficacy using human challenge
- **Study type**: Summary of Maryland CHIM program
- **Institution**: University of Maryland School of Medicine
- **Funding**: Army Research and Development Command; USPHS Grant No. E 11327

## Key Data - Dose Response (Table I, p.72)

| Dose (organisms) | N challenged | N with typhoid | Attack rate |
|------------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| 10^9 | 42 | 40 | 95% |
| 10^8 | 9 | 8 | 89% |
| 10^7 | 32 | 16 | 50% |
| 10^5 | 116 | 32 | 28% |
| 10^3 | 20 | 0 | 0% |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Note: 10^3 shows N=20 here vs N=14 in other papers. This suggests ongoing enrollment - the cumulative totals grew across publications.

## Strain Information
- **Quailes strain**: "Isolated from a typhoid carrier who had demonstrated its virulence recently by causing typhoid in the family" (p.71)
- Earlier attempt with Ty2 strain: "Each volunteer ingested six million viable typhoid bacilli of the standard Ty2 strain. There was no clinical evidence of infection" (p.71)

## Challenge Protocol Details
- "Typhoid bacilli previously isolated from the carrier and preserved by freezing were reconstituted, subcultured and placed in milk"
- "Volunteers gargled and swallowed approximately one ounce of infected inoculum" (p.71)

## Clinical Observations (p.72)
- "Approximately 170 men" treated for typhoid fever during studies
- "No serious complications of any type"
- "A few have shown a little occult bleeding"
- "No instances of perforation of the intestine"
- "Two instances of moderate hemolytic anemia"
- "Several developed temporary psychotic episodes"
- "There have been no carriers"

## Vaccine Results Summary (p.73)
- "At this challenge level [ID25], only about eight per cent of the vaccinees (K and L) became ill, or 92 per cent were protected"
- "25 per cent of the non-vaccinated controls developed typhoid fever or 75 per cent did not become ill"
- "A few volunteers given a purified Vi vaccine showed the same level of protection, no more or less than with vaccines K and L"

## Re-infection Data (p.73)
- "Illness was subsequently reproduced in some of the volunteers six months and one year after the primary infection using the same strain and the same dose of infecting bacilli"
- "Hence, the prior clinical experience had not led to solid immunity"

## Discussion - Key Points for Modeling (p.74)

### Natural Resistance
- "The vast majority of vaccinated or non-vaccinated human subjects failed to develop typhoid fever after ingesting pathogenic bacilli"
- "We believe that focus must be placed upon the ecology of the intestinal tract in order to understand susceptibility as well as defense against infection"

### Stool Shedding vs Disease
- "Multiplication of bacteria does take place in the gastrointestinal tract and in the human trials just as many of these persons failed to develop typhoid fever as those who did"
- "There was no serologic response in those vaccinated or unvaccinated volunteers who did not show evidence of circulatory invasion by typhoid bacilli"

## Cross-References
- Conference proceedings version of ongoing Maryland studies
- Data overlap with Hornick 1966, 1967 papers
- 10^3 N increased from 14 to 20 between publications

## Fit Role Assessment
**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **SUPPORT** - Overlaps with other Hornick papers; contains discussion useful for understanding resistance mechanisms
