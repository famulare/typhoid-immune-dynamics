**DOI/Source**: NEJM Vol. 283 No. 14

## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Review of typhoid fever pathogenesis and immunologic control mechanisms
- **Study type**: Review/summary paper synthesizing Maryland volunteer studies
- **Institution**: Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine
- **Funding**: Contract DA-49-193-MD-2867 with Department of the Army; WHO grant-in-aid

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This is a review paper - most data presented here are re-presentations of data from earlier primary publications. Should be used to cross-check and fill gaps, but primary papers should take precedence for original data.

## Challenge Protocol

### Strain
- **Name**: Quailes strain (same as other Maryland studies)
- **Also mentions**: S-27 strain (streptomycin-dependent mutant) for oral vaccine studies

### Dose & Delivery
- Paper discusses various doses used across the program
- ID50 referenced as 10^7 (10,000,000) organisms
- ID25 referenced as 10^5 (100,000) organisms

## Key Data Tables

### Table 5: Occurrence of Typhoid Fever in Vaccinated Volunteers after Graded Challenges with S. Typhosa (p.744)

**[CRITICAL DATA - MULTI-DOSE WITH VACCINATION STATUS]**

| Vaccine | 10^9 Organisms | | 10^7 Organisms | | 10^5 Organisms | |
|---------|----------------|---------|----------------|---------|----------------|---------|
| | N | Disease (%) | N | Disease (%) | N | Disease (%) |
| K | 3 | 2 (67%) | 28 | 12 (43%) | 43 | 4 (9%)† |
| L | 4 | 3 (75%) | 24 | 13 (54%) | 45 | 3 (7%)† |
| Vi | 7 | 6 (86%) | 14 | 10 (71%) | 17 | 3 (18%) |
| None | 4 | 4 (100%) | 30 | 15 (50%) | 104 | 28 (24%) |

*S. typhi Quailes strain
†Chi-square test: K versus control, p<0.05; L versus control, p<0.02; all vaccinees including Vi, p<0.01

**Key observations**:
- Unvaccinated controls ("None"): 100% at 10^9, 50% at 10^7, 24% at 10^5
- K and L vaccines show ~67% efficacy at 10^5 dose
- Vi vaccine shows less protection than K or L
- At overwhelming dose (10^9), vaccines provide little protection

### Table 3: Results of WHO Field Trials with Vaccines K and L - Two Doses (p.743)

| Country | Period | Age Range | Composition | Vaccine Group K | | Vaccine Group L | | Control | | Effectiveness (%) |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|--|-----------------|--|---------|--|-------------------|
| | | | | cases typhoid | persons in trial | cases typhoid | persons in trial | cases typhoid | persons in trial | K | L |
| Yugoslavia | 1960-1963 | 2-50 | Mainly schoolchildren | 16 | 5,028 | 37 | 5,068 | 75 | 5,039 | 79 | 51 |
| Guyana | 1960-1964 | 5-15 | Schoolchildren | 6 | 24,046 | 26 | 23,431 | 99 | 24,241 | 94 | 73 |
| Poland | 1961-1963 | 5-14 | Schoolchildren | 4 | 81,534 | | | 31 | 83,734 | 87 | |
| USSR | 1962-1963 | | Schoolchildren & young adults | | | 13 | 36,112 | 50 | 36,999 | | 73 |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This is field trial data, not CHIM data - useful for context but different exposure conditions

### Table 4: Typhoid Fever among Volunteers and Nonparticipants in Yugoslavia Field Trial (p.744)

| Type of Vaccine | Cases of Typhoid | No. of Persons | Rate/1000 | Effectiveness (%) |
|-----------------|------------------|----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| K | 13 | 3,346 | 3.9 | 70 |
| L | 20 | 3,386 | 5.9 | 53 |
| Control | 43 | 3,340 | 12.9 | 0 |
| Total volunteers | 76 | 10,072 | 7.5 | |
| Nonparticipants | 777 | 9,500 | 81.8 | |

## Re-challenge/Acquired Immunity Data (p.742)

**Natural immunity from prior infection:**
- Marmion et al. 1953: Two epidemics of typhoid fever within 5 months in British Air Force camp in Egypt
- 54 men from first epidemic re-exposed in second
- Overall attack rate 34% vs 20% in re-exposed group
- "These data suggested that natural disease conferred moderate immunity"

**Experimental re-challenge:**
- "In the present study, volunteers with previous induced disease were selected because of previous disease and rechallenged with identical doses of the same phage-type organisms, two to 12 months later. Their illness rate was now about 25 per cent."
- "In this group of initially susceptible volunteers, substantial immunity appears to have been acquired"
- "No correlation between resistance and O, H and Vi antibody levels was demonstrated"

**[OPEN]** The "25%" re-challenge illness rate is critical for γ estimation but exact N not given

## Immunity Observations

### Lack of Antibody Correlation (p.742, p.744)
- "There was no correlation between base-line O, H or Vi antibodies and resistance to illness or relapse" (p.742)
- Analysis of humoral antibodies "failed to show any demonstrable effect in protecting volunteers from illness" (p.744)
- IgG and IgM grouping showed no relationship to disease response

### Vi Antigen Discussion (p.739)
- "Vi antigen appears important in enhancing human virulence of typhoid strains"
- Purified Vi vaccine gave less protection than K and L vaccines (Table 5)
- "This evidence, plus the failure to demonstrate superiority of vaccine K over vaccine L, indicates that the Vi antigen may not be of major importance in inducing protective antibodies in man"

## Volunteer Study Context (p.745)

- Studies conducted under Declaration of Helsinki guidelines
- Initial peer review by Armed Forces Epidemiological Board
- Annual reviews by Board commissions
- Intramural approval achieved by peer-group review
- Public Health Service volunteer committee approval (1966 requirement)
- "Volunteers in these studies were informed inmates at the Maryland House of Correction"
- "Each man was asked to participate after having the nature of the study explained. No coercion was used, and each man was free to withdraw at any time."

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Comprehensive summary of Maryland program
- Table 5 provides clean dose-stratified data with vaccination status
- Documents lack of antibody-protection correlation

### Limitations
- Review paper - should cross-reference primary sources
- Some N values small (especially at 10^9 dose)
- Re-challenge data lacks precise denominators

## Cross-References
- **Primary data sources**: Hornick 1966, Hornick 1967, and other Maryland papers
- This paper synthesizes and summarizes those earlier publications
- Table 5 data likely overlap with data presented graphically in Hornick 1966 Figure 3
- WHO field trial data (Tables 3-4) from Cvjetanović & Uemura references

## Fit Role Assessment
**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **SUPPORT** - Review paper; Table 5 provides useful clean tabulation of multi-dose data but should cross-check against primary sources. Re-challenge data valuable for immunity estimation.

## Key Extractions for Calibration

### Unvaccinated control dose-response (Table 5):
| Dose | N | Disease | Rate |
|------|---|---------|------|
| 10^9 | 4 | 4 | 100% |
| 10^7 | 30 | 15 | 50% |
| 10^5 | 104 | 28 | 27% |

### Vaccinated dose-response (Table 5, K+L combined):
| Dose | N | Disease | Rate |
|------|---|---------|------|
| 10^9 | 7 | 5 | 71% |
| 10^7 | 52 | 25 | 48% |
| 10^5 | 88 | 7 | 8% |

**[OPEN]** K and L vaccines differ in Vi antigen preservation - should they be combined or kept separate for modeling?
