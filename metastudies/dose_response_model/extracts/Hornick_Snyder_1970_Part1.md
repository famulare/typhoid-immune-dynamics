## Study Overview
- **Primary question**: Comprehensive review of typhoid pathogenesis from volunteer studies
- **Study type**: Review of Maryland CHIM program with detailed pathogenesis data
- **Institution**: Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine
- **Funding**: Contract DA-49-193-MD-2867 with Department of the Army; WHO grant-in-aid
- **Population**: "Informed inmates at the Maryland House of Correction" - healthy adult male volunteers with limited prior typhoid exposure (p.686)

## Challenge Protocol

### Strain
- **Name**: Quailes strain of *S. typhosa* (now *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi)
- **Source**: Obtained from a carrier (p.687)
- **Characteristics**: Contains Vi antigen; well-studied virulence; propagated on solid and liquid media; harvested approximately six hours after 37°C incubation (p.687)

### Dose & Delivery
- Suspended in 30 ml of milk
- Administered by gargling and swallowing (p.687)
- Doses tested: 10^3, 10^5, 10^7, 10^8, 10^9 viable organisms

### Disease Definition (p.687)
- "A standard protocol was established to estimate vaccine effect. Thus, antibiotic treatment was begun when the temperature reached 103°F or higher, by mouth, and persisted at that level for 24 to 36 hours."

## Dose-Response Data (Table 1, p.687)

**CRITICAL - Most complete dose-response table with incubation periods**

| Dose | N Volunteers | N with Disease | Attack Rate | Incubation (Median) | Incubation (Range) |
|------|--------------|----------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 10^9 | 42 | 40 (95%) | 95% | 5 days | 3-32 days |
| 10^8 | 9 | 8 (89%) | 89% | - | - |
| 10^7 | 32 | 16 (50%) | 50% | 7.5 days | 4-56 days |
| 10^5 | 116 | 32 (28%) | 28% | 9 days | 6-33 days |
| 10^3 | 14 | 0 (-) | 0% | - | - |

**Key observations**:
- ID50 is approximately 10^7 organisms (p.687)
- "Most commonly employed dose, 100,000 S. typhosa, caused disease in 28 per cent of the volunteers" (p.688)
- "The smallest dose employed, 1000 cells, failed to induce disease in any of the 14 volunteers" (p.688)
- Incubation period inversely related to dose; range highly variable within dose groups

## Strain Virulence Comparison (Table 2, p.690)

**CRITICAL - Shows INFECTION vs DISEASE distinction and Vi antigen effect**

Challenge dose: ~10^7 organisms

### Vi-containing strains:
| Strain | Mouse LD50 | Disease† | Infection‡ | No Infection§ | Total |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Quailes | 2.8 × 10^2 | 16 of 30 | 12 of 30 | 2 of 30 | 30 |
| Zermatt | 3.0 × 10^4 | 6 of 11 | 4 of 11 | 1 of 11 | 11 |
| Ty2V | 3.0 × 10^6 | 2 of 6 | 3 of 6 | 1 of 6 | 6 |
| **Totals (Vi)** | — | **24 of 47 (51%)** | **19 of 47 (40%)** | **4 of 47 (9%)** | 47 |

### Non-Vi strains:
| Strain | Mouse LD50 | Disease† | Infection‡ | No Infection§ | Total |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| 0-901 | 3.11 × 10^5 | 6 of 20 | 6 of 20 | 8 of 20 | 20 |
| Ty2W | 1.9 × 10^5 | 4 of 19 | 10 of 19 | 5 of 19 | 19 |
| **Totals (non-Vi)** | — | **10 of 39 (26%)** | **16 of 39 (41%)** | **13 of 39 (33%)** | 39 |

**Footnote definitions** (p.690):
- †Disease: Temperature ≥103°F for >36 hr & treatment with antibiotic
- ‡Infection: Low-grade fever or significant serological response, or positive blood culture or excretion of S. typhosa in stools for >5 days & no specific therapy
- §No Infection: No clinical, cultural or serologic evidence

**[CRITICAL]** This table separates DISEASE from INFECTION outcomes - essential for model that distinguishes infection from fever!

### Vi Antigen Effect
- Disease rates significantly higher for Vi strains (51%) vs non-Vi strains (26%), p < 0.05

## Clinical Description

### Treatment Summary (p.687)
- 250 men received antibiotic treatment (215 with chloramphenicol) for typhoid fever
- Two cases of moderate hemolytic anemia occurred before chloramphenicol given
- Several volunteers had temporary episodes of confusion
- "There have been no permanent typhoid carriers"
- Volunteers "usually afebrile by the third to the fifth day of therapy"

## Pathogenesis Observations

### Bacteremia and Fecal Shedding (p.687-688)
- Typhoid bacilli noted in feces on first two days after pathogen ingestion
- Subsequent stool specimens failed to reveal typhoid bacilli during incubation
- Highest typhoid "O" titer noted on 15th and 17th days
- "In volunteers given 10^5 to 10^7 organisms, the presence of S. typhi in the stools for the first five days after challenge did not necessarily mean that they would become ill"
- Initial stool shedding "is not a definite indication of failing host defense"

### Asymptomatic Bacteremia (p.690)
- "In two of 64 patients this condition was documented"
- In one volunteer: bacteremia occurred for 10 days with no overt clinical disease and no fever

### Streptomycin Pre-challenge Effect (p.689)
- 14 volunteers given 1000 viable typhoid bacilli
- "One of four treated volunteers became clinically ill"
- "Oral prechallenge of volunteers with streptomycin (no effect on the typhoid bacilli) may have similarly influenced intestinal defense mechanisms"

## Strain Information

### Quailes Strain (Primary Challenge Strain)
- Contains Vi antigen
- Mouse LD50: 2.8 × 10^2 (intraperitoneal)
- "Well studied, and its virulence in relation to other classic typhoid strains has been defined" (p.687)

### Other Strains Tested
- **Zermatt**: Isolated from Dr. Vischer, Basel, from 1963 epidemic; contains Vi; mouse LD50 3.0 × 10^4
- **Ty2V**: Classic strain; contains Vi; mouse LD50 3.0 × 10^6
- **0-901**: From Russian village 1915 (Felix isolate); lacks Vi; mouse LD50 3.11 × 10^5
- **Ty2W**: Derived from Ty2V; lacks Vi; mouse LD50 1.9 × 10^5

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Table 1 provides the most complete dose-response data with incubation periods for Quailes strain
- Table 2 uniquely separates disease vs. infection outcomes - critical for modeling
- Clear disease definition with standardized treatment protocol
- Large sample sizes at 10^5 (N=116) and 10^9 (N=42) doses

### Limitations
- No incubation data reported for 10^8 or 10^3 dose groups
- **[OPEN]** Slight discrepancy in N for 10^7 dose (Table 1: N=32, 16 disease; Table 2 Quailes only: N=30, 16 disease). May reflect different analysis subsets or inclusion of other Vi strains in Table 1
- Review paper synthesizing data from multiple publications; primary sources should be checked
- No individual-level data available

## Cross-References
- Part 1 of 2-part NEJM review
- Part 2 (Hornick_Snyder_1970.md) contains vaccine efficacy data and re-challenge data
- Data overlap with earlier Hornick publications (1966, 1967) but this has the cleanest tables
- Related refs in paper: DuPont 1969 (shigella vaccines), Snyder 1963 (asymptomatic bacteremia)

## Fit Role Assessment
**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **CORE** - Contains the most complete dose-response data AND the critical infection vs disease distinction needed for model. Table 2 is unique in showing this separation.

## Key Extractions for Calibration

### Dose-Response for Fever (Table 1, Quailes strain):

| Dose | N | Disease | Attack Rate |
|------|---|---------|-------------|
| 10^9 | 42 | 40 | 95.2% |
| 10^8 | 9 | 8 | 88.9% |
| 10^7 | 32 | 16 | 50.0% |
| 10^5 | 116 | 32 | 27.6% |
| 10^3 | 14 | 0 | 0.0% |

### For Infection Model (Quailes strain, 10^7 dose):
- 30 challenged
- 28 infected (disease + infection categories) = 93%
- 2 no infection = 7%

### For Fever|Infection Model (Quailes strain, 10^7 dose):
- 28 infected
- 16 disease = 57% of infected developed fever

### Vi Antigen Effect on Virulence (Table 2, all strains at ~10^7):
- Vi strains: 51% disease, 91% infection
- Non-Vi strains: 26% disease, 67% infection
- Chi-square p < 0.05 for disease difference

**[OPEN]** How to reconcile Table 1 (32 challenged at 10^7, 16 disease) with Table 2 (30 challenged at 10^7, 16 disease)? Small discrepancy likely due to different analysis subsets.
