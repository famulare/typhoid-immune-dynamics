## Study Overview

- **Primary question**: Comprehensive review of typhoid pathogenesis and dose-response data from the Maryland volunteer studies
- **Study type**: Review and synthesis of Maryland CHIM (Controlled Human Infection Model) program data
- **Institution**: Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Maryland School of Medicine
- **Funding**: Contract DA-49-193-MD-2867 with Department of the Army; WHO grant-in-aid
- **Population studied**: "Informed inmates at the Maryland House of Correction" who were healthy adult male volunteers with limited prior typhoid exposure (p.686)

## Challenge Protocol Details

### Strain
- **Name**: Quailes strain of *S. typhosa* (now *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhi)
- **Source**: Obtained from a carrier (p.687)
- **Characteristics**: Contains Vi (envelope) antigen; propagated on solid and liquid media; harvested approximately six hours after 37°C incubation (p.687)

### Dose & Delivery
- Suspended in 30 ml of milk
- Administered by gargling and swallowing (p.687)
- Doses tested: 10^3, 10^5, 10^7, 10^8, 10^9 viable organisms

### Disease Definition (p.687)
- "A standard protocol was established to estimate vaccine effect"
- Treatment initiated "when the temperature reached 103°F or higher, by mouth, and persisted at that level for 24 to 36 hours"
- Clinical manifestations arrested by chloramphenicol administration
- Volunteers "usually afebrile by the third to the fifth day of therapy"

## Outcomes Measured

1. **Disease (Typhoid Fever)**: Temperature ≥103°F (39.4°C) by mouth for 24-36 hours requiring antibiotic treatment
2. **Infection without disease**: Low-grade fever OR significant serological response OR positive blood culture OR S. typhosa excretion in stools >5 days without specific therapy (from Table 2 footnotes, p.690)
3. **No infection**: No clinical, cultural, or serologic evidence (Table 2 footnote, p.690)
4. **Incubation period**: Days from ingestion to fever onset

## Dose-Response Data

### Table 1: Relation of Dosage of S. typhosa - Quailes Strain - to Disease (p.687)

**CRITICAL - Most complete dose-response table with incubation periods**

| Dose (Viable S. Typhosa) | N Volunteers | N with Disease (%) | Incubation Median (days) | Incubation Range (days) |
|--------------------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 10^9 | 42 | 40 (95%) | 5 | 3-32 |
| 10^8 | 9 | 8 (89%) | — | — |
| 10^7 | 32 | 16 (50%) | 7.5 | 4-56 |
| 10^5 | 116 | 32 (28%) | 9 | 6-33 |
| 10^3 | 14 | 0 (—) | — | — |

**Key observations**:
- ID50 is approximately 10^7 organisms (p.687)
- "Most commonly employed dose, 100,000 S. typhosa, caused disease in 28 per cent of the volunteers" (p.688)
- "The smallest dose employed, 1000 cells, failed to induce disease in any of the 14 volunteers" (p.688)
- Incubation period inversely related to dose; range highly variable within dose groups

### Table 2: Virulence of Certain Strains of Typhoid Bacilli for Man (p.690)

**CRITICAL - Shows INFECTION vs DISEASE distinction and Vi antigen effect**

Challenge dose: ~10^7 organisms

#### Vi-containing strains:

| Strain | Mouse LD50 | Disease† | Infection‡ | No Infection§ | Total |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| Quailes | 2.8 × 10^2 | 16 of 30 | 12 of 30 | 2 of 30 | 30 |
| Zermatt | 3.0 × 10^4 | 6 of 11 | 4 of 11 | 1 of 11 | 11 |
| Ty2V | 3.0 × 10^6 | 2 of 6 | 3 of 6 | 1 of 6 | 6 |
| **Totals (Vi strains)** | — | **24 of 47 (51%)** | **19 of 47 (40%)** | **4 of 47 (9%)** | 47 |

#### Non-Vi strains:

| Strain | Mouse LD50 | Disease† | Infection‡ | No Infection§ | Total |
|--------|------------|----------|------------|---------------|-------|
| 0-901 | 3.11 × 10^5 | 6 of 20 | 6 of 20 | 8 of 20 | 20 |
| Ty2W | 1.9 × 10^5 | 4 of 19 | 10 of 19 | 5 of 19 | 19 |
| **Totals (non-Vi strains)** | — | **10 of 39 (26%)** | **16 of 39 (41%)** | **13 of 39 (33%)** | 39 |

**Footnote definitions** (p.690):
- *Mouse virulence evaluated by intraperitoneal inoculation of organisms in saline; Zermatt-strain virulence determined with organisms in gastric mucin
- †Disease: Temperature of 103°F or higher for >36 hr & treatment with antibiotic
- ‡Infection: Low-grade fever or significant serological response, or positive blood culture or excretion of S. typhosa in stools for >5 days & no specific therapy
- §No Infection: No clinical, cultural or serologic evidence
- ¶Chi-square test difference between incidence of disease caused by Vi & non-Vi strains significant (p < 0.05)

**[CRITICAL]** This table separates DISEASE from INFECTION outcomes - essential for model that distinguishes infection from fever!

### Vi Antigen Effect
- Disease rates significantly higher for Vi strains (51%) vs non-Vi strains (26%), p < 0.05

## Additional Clinical and Pathogenesis Data

### Bacteremia and Fecal Shedding (p.687-688)
- Typhoid bacilli noted in feces on first two days after pathogen ingestion
- Subsequent stool specimens failed to reveal typhoid bacilli during incubation
- Highest typhoid "O" titer noted on 15th and 17th days
- "In volunteers given 10^5 to 10^7 organisms, the presence of S. typhi in the stools for the first five days after challenge did not necessarily mean that they would become ill" (p.688)
- Initial stool shedding "is not a definite indication of failing host defense"

### Treatment Summary (p.687)
- 250 men received antibiotic treatment (215 with chloramphenicol) for typhoid fever
- Two cases of moderate hemolytic anemia before chloramphenicol given
- Several volunteers had temporary episodes of confusion
- "There have been no permanent typhoid carriers"

### Asymptomatic Bacteremia (p.690)
- "In two of 64 patients this condition was documented"
- In one volunteer: bacteremia occurred for 10 days with no overt clinical disease and no fever

### Streptomycin Pre-challenge Effect (p.689)
- 14 volunteers given 1000 viable typhoid bacilli
- "One of four treated volunteers became clinically ill"
- "Oral prechallenge of volunteers with streptomycin (no effect on the typhoid bacilli) may have similarly influenced intestinal defense mechanisms"

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- **Page 687**: Table 1 provides the most complete dose-response data with incubation periods for Quailes strain
- **Page 690**: Table 2 uniquely separates disease vs. infection outcomes - critical for distinguishing infection probability from disease probability
- Clear disease definition with standardized treatment protocol
- Large sample sizes at 10^5 (N=116) and 10^9 (N=42) doses

### Limitations
- **Page 687**: No incubation data reported for 10^8 or 10^3 dose groups
- **[OPEN]** Page 690, Table 1 vs Table 2: Slight discrepancy in N for 10^7 dose (Table 1: N=32, 16 disease; Table 2 Quailes only: N=30, 16 disease). This suggests Table 1 may include 2 additional volunteers from other Vi strains, or different analysis subsets
- Review paper synthesizing data from multiple publications; primary sources should be checked
- No individual-level data available

## Fit Role Assessment

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** **CORE** - Contains the most complete dose-response data AND the critical infection vs disease distinction needed for model. Table 2 is unique in showing this separation.

## Key Extractions for Calibration

### Dose-Response for Fever (Table 1, Quailes strain):

| Dose | N | Disease | Attack Rate |
|------|---|---------|-------------|
| 10^9 | 42 | 40 | 95.2% |
| 10^8 | 9 | 8 | 88.9% |
| 10^7 | 32 | 16 | 50.0% |
| 10^5 | 116 | 32 | 27.6% |
| 10^3 | 14 | 0 | 0.0% |

### For Infection Model (Quailes strain, 10^7 dose):
- 30 challenged
- 28 infected (disease + infection categories) = 93%
- 2 no infection = 7%

### For Fever|Infection Model (Quailes strain, 10^7 dose):
- 28 infected
- 16 disease = 57% of infected developed fever

### Vi Antigen Effect on Virulence (Table 2, all strains at ~10^7):
- Vi strains: 51% disease, 91% infection
- Non-Vi strains: 26% disease, 67% infection
- Chi-square p < 0.05 for disease difference

**[OPEN]** The infection vs disease distinction from Table 2 is unique to this paper and critical for modeling P(fever|infection). Need to verify if the 10^7 dose data in Table 1 (N=32) and Table 2 (N=30 for Quailes) can be reconciled or represent different volunteer subsets.
