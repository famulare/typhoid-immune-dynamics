## Study Overview

**Study Type:** Secondary immunological analysis of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled vaccine trial with controlled human infection model (CHIM)

**Primary Objective:** Investigate the functional role of bactericidal antibodies induced by oral typhoid vaccines in protection against typhoid fever after challenge with wild-type *S. Typhi*

**Key Finding:** Bactericidal antibodies (mediated by anti-O:LPS antibodies) do not provide sterile immunity but significantly reduce disease severity, delay disease onset, and lower bacterial burden in vaccinated participants

**Study Location:** Centre for Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford, UK

**Study Period:** Not explicitly stated; published January 2018

## Subject Characteristics

### Enrollment
- **Total Enrolled:** 99 adult participants [p. 2]

| Ty21a | Three doses, each containing 2 × 10^9 CFU | 33 |
| Placebo | Placebo control | 33 |

### SBA Substudy Population
Serum samples evaluated from a subset with similar numbers across arms [p. 2]:
- Placebo: n = 18
- Ty21a: n = 16
- M01ZH09: n = 18
- **Total with TD (typhoid diagnosis):** n = 30
- **Total nTD (no typhoid diagnosis):** n = 22

## Baseline Immunity

### Pre-existing Bactericidal Activity
- All study participants showed bactericidal activity against wild-type *S.* Typhi at baseline (D-28, pre-vaccination) [p. 4]
- 2-log10 range in titers at baseline
- No significant differences between vaccine arms at baseline [p. 4, Figure 1A]

### Explanation for Baseline Activity
- Variants of O9:LPS antigen are abundant in Enterobacteriaceae, including gut commensals, which may explain presence of baseline bactericidal activity [p. 9]

### Anti-Vi Antibodies
- Negligible anti-Vi titers observed in almost all tested samples [p. 4, Figure S2A]
- Neither vaccine (Ty21a nor M01ZH09) constitutively expresses Vi at significant levels [p. 2]

## Dose-Outcome Data

### Challenge Outcomes by Arm
[OPEN] **Note:** Specific TD/nTD counts per arm not provided in this paper. The primary efficacy results are reported in Darton et al. 2016 (reference 14).

From SBA substudy (n = 52 total):
- TD: n = 30
- nTD: n = 22

### Key Quantitative Findings

#### Bactericidal Activity and Disease Correlations (Vaccinated TD participants, M01ZH09 + Ty21a combined)
| Parameter | n | Spearman rho | p-value | Page Ref |
|-----------|---|--------------|---------|----------|
| Day of diagnosis | 18 | 0.58 | **0.013** | Table 1 |
| Bacterial count (CFU/mL) | 14 | -0.69 | **0.006** | Table 1 |
| Symptom severity score | 19 | -0.52 | **0.021** | Table 1 |
| Max temperature | 19 | -0.26 | 0.277 | Table 1 |
| TNF-α (max) | 15 | -0.60 | **0.019** | Table 1 |
| IL-6 (max) | 14 | -0.71 | **0.005** | Table 1 |
| IL-8 (max) | 15 | -0.69 | **0.004** | Table 1 |

**Interpretation:** Higher D0 bactericidal titers in vaccinated participants correlated with:
- Delayed disease onset (positive correlation)
- Lower bacterial burden (negative correlation)
- Reduced symptom severity (negative correlation)
- Lower pro-inflammatory cytokines (negative correlations)

#### Placebo TD Participants
No significant correlations between D0 SBA titers and any disease parameter [Table 1]

#### Protection Analysis
- No significant difference in D0 SBA titers between TD and nTD participants overall [p. 4, Figure 1D]
- No association between SBA titers at D0 and protection against TD in any vaccine arm [Figure S1A]

### Antibody Depletion Effects on Bactericidal Activity [p. 4, 6, Figure 3]
| Depletion Target | Effect on SBA | p-value |
|------------------|---------------|---------|
| O9:LPS antibodies | Significant reduction | **0.009** |
| Flagellin (H) antibodies | No significant effect | n.s. |
| Total IgA | No significant effect | n.s. |

## Key Findings Summary

1. **Bactericidal antibodies do NOT protect against typhoid infection** - no difference in D0 titers between TD and nTD [p. 4]

2. **Bactericidal antibodies reduce disease severity in vaccinated individuals:**
   - Delayed disease onset (p = 0.013)
   - Lower bacterial burden (p = 0.006)
   - Decreased symptom severity (p = 0.021)
   - Reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines

3. **Bactericidal activity is mediated by anti-O:LPS antibodies** - O9:LPS depletion significantly reduced activity (p = 0.009) [p. 6]

4. **M01ZH09 induced significant increase in SBA** (p = 0.001) while Ty21a did not [p. 4]

5. **Wild-type challenge induced bactericidal antibodies only in those who developed TD** (placebo and Ty21a arms) [p. 4]

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Controlled human infection model with defined dose (10^4 CFU)
- Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design
- Multiple time points for immunological assessment
- Mechanistic depletion experiments to identify antibody targets
- Correlation of functional antibodies with clinical outcomes

### Limitations
- **Low statistical power** explicitly acknowledged due to reliance on multiple samples from same individuals [p. 9]
- SBA not measured at D28 post-challenge in nTD participants due to residual ciprofloxacin interference [p. 3]
- Single challenge dose level (10^4 CFU) - no dose-response data for infection outcomes
- Vi antibody role could not be determined due to negligible immune response to capsular antigen [p. 9]
- Specific TD/nTD counts per arm not reported in this paper

### Missing Data
- [OPEN] Primary efficacy data (attack rates per arm) must be obtained from Darton et al. 2016
- [OPEN] Individual-level data on time to diagnosis, bacterial counts, symptom scores
- Demographic details for subset analyzed

## Fit Role

**Role:** Support

**Justification:**
- [ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] This study provides **single dose-level challenge data (10^4 CFU)** with detailed immunological correlates but does not directly inform dose-response modeling for infection probability
- The study's value is in demonstrating that:
  - Bactericidal antibodies reduce disease severity but not infection probability
  - Anti-O:LPS antibodies mediate bactericidal activity
  - Immune correlates affect time-to-diagnosis and symptom severity
- For dose-response modeling, the **primary efficacy paper (Darton 2016)** and the **dose-escalation paper (Waddington 2014)** are more directly relevant
- However, this paper provides important mechanistic context for understanding why antibody titers may not correlate with protection against infection

**Recommendation:**
- [OPEN] Obtain Darton 2016 and Waddington 2014 for core dose-response data
- Use this paper for mechanistic interpretation of antibody-mediated effects on disease severity (distinct from protection against infection)
