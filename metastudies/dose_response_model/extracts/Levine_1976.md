## Study Overview

This paper reports four vaccination trials (1970-1973) testing streptomycin-dependent *S. typhi* strain 27v as an oral attenuated typhoid vaccine, followed by challenge with virulent *S. typhi*. The primary focus is on comparing fresh vs. lyophilized vaccine preparations.

**Primary finding:** Fresh vaccine provided significant protection (66-78% efficacy), while lyophilized vaccine provided no clinical protection despite similar excretion rates and immunogenicity in mouse models.

**Study design:** Four sequential trials with vaccination followed by challenge approximately 6 weeks later.

## Challenge Protocol

### Challenge Strain
- **Strain:** Quailes strain of *Salmonella typhi*
- **Dose:** 10^5 virulent organisms (p. 425)
- **Delivery:** Oral, in 45 ml of milk (p. 425)
- **Timing:** Six weeks after completion of vaccination (p. 425)

### Pre-challenge Preparation
- 2 grams NaHCO3 in 8 oz water given 5 minutes before vaccine administration (p. 425)
- [OPEN] It is not explicitly stated whether NaHCO3 was also given before challenge; presumably yes given the standard protocol described.

## Subject Characteristics

- **Population:** Healthy adult male inmates of the Maryland House of Correction, Jessup, Maryland (p. 424)
- **Total vaccinated:** 176 men across four trials (p. 425)
- **Age:** Adults (specific age range not provided)
- **Sex:** All male
- **Health status:** Baseline health status ascertained from medical history, physical examination, electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, blood chemistry, urinalysis, complete blood count, and oral cholecystogram (p. 425)
- **Informed consent:** Obtained; protocols reviewed by University of Maryland Committee on Human Experimentation (p. 424-425)

## Baseline Immunity

- Sera collected before vaccination for antibodies to O-, H-, and Vi-antigen (p. 425)
- **H-antibody:** Control volunteers with preexistent H-antibody titers >=20 had lower attack rate than those without (22% vs. 48%; P = 0.005) (p. 427)
- [ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] This suggests variable baseline immunity in the study population, though specific exclusion criteria based on titers are not mentioned.

## Outcome Definitions

### Typhoid Fever (Primary Outcome)
- **Definition:** Acute illness with oral temperature >= 101 F accompanied by isolation of *S. typhi* from blood or stool (p. 425)

### Treatment Criteria
- Volunteers with temperatures >= 103 F for 24 hr OR >= 101 F for 48 hr received chloramphenicol therapy (p. 425)

### Secondary Outcomes
- **Bacteremia:** Blood culture positive for *S. typhi*
- **Fecal excretion:** Stool culture positive for *S. typhi* at <72 hr, >72 hr, and anytime after challenge
- **Serological response:** Fourfold rise in O-, H-, or Vi-antibody titers

### Calculated Vaccine Efficacy

| Trial | Vaccine Type | Attack Rate Vaccinees | Attack Rate Controls | Vaccine Efficacy |
|-------|--------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Fresh | 17% | 50% | 66% |
| 2 | Lyophilized | 33% | 30% | -10% (no protection) |
| 3 | Fresh | 12% | 55% | 78% |
| 4 | Lyophilized | 18% | 25% | 28% (not significant) |

*[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] Efficacy calculated as 1 - (AR_vaccinated/AR_control)*

### Pooled Control Data (Unvaccinated)

| Outcome | N | Events | Attack Rate |
|---------|---|--------|-------------|
| Typhoid fever | 97 | 39 | 40.2% |

*[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] Pooled from all four control groups challenged with 10^5 Quailes strain*

### Challenge Dose Context

- The 10^5 dose was characterized as a "highly infective inocula" representing approximately 50% and 55% infectious doses based on the control group attack rates in fresh vaccine trials (p. 427)
- [ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] This single challenge dose limits dose-response modeling but provides a valuable data point for calibration.

## Serological Response to Vaccination

| Trial | Vaccine Type | H-antibody 4-fold rise (%) | O-antibody 4-fold rise (%) | Vi-antibody 4-fold rise (%) |
|-------|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| 1 | Fresh | 54% | 9% | 12% |
| 2 | Lyophilized | 38% | 6% | 32% |
| 3 | Fresh | 65% | 8% | 12% |
| 4 | Lyophilized | 18% | 0% | 0% |

## Data Quality Notes

### Strengths
- Well-controlled challenge study design with concurrent controls (p. 425-426)
- Standardized challenge protocol with defined dose (10^5 organisms) and delivery method (p. 425)
- Clear outcome definitions with both clinical and microbiological endpoints (p. 425)
- Bacteriological confirmation required for typhoid fever diagnosis (p. 425)

### Limitations
- **Single challenge dose:** Only 10^5 organisms used; no dose-response curve generated (p. 425)
- **Sample size variation:** Control group sizes vary (16-33) across trials (Table 2, p. 426)
- **Sequential trials:** Different years, potentially different subject populations and conditions
- **Incomplete bacteriology data:** Trial 3 had bacteriologic data for only 24 of 44 vaccinees (Table 1, p. 426)
- **Treatment confounding:** Subjects meeting temperature thresholds were treated with chloramphenicol, potentially affecting natural history outcomes (p. 425)

## Cross-References

- **DuPont et al. 1971** (ref 14): Earlier evaluation of live streptomycin-dependent vaccine; provides background on vaccination protocol
- **Hornick et al. 1970** (ref 6): Comprehensive review of typhoid pathogenesis and immunologic control from the Maryland group; likely contains additional challenge data with Quailes strain
- **Gilman et al. 1975** (ref 19): Related study using epimerase-less *S. typhi* mutant; noted similar finding about preexistent H-antibody protection

## Fit Role

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] Support**

### Rationale
- **Not Core because:** Single challenge dose (10^5) does not allow direct dose-response curve fitting
- **Support because:**
  - Provides well-characterized attack rate data at 10^5 dose in unvaccinated controls (~40% pooled)
  - Confirms Quailes strain challenge methodology used in the Maryland studies
  - Useful for validating dose-response models at the 10^5 dose level
  - Control group data can be pooled with other Maryland studies using same strain and methods
- **Not Exclude because:** Data quality is high; standardized methods; clear outcome definitions

### Specific Use
- Control group challenge data (pooled n=97, attack rate ~40% at 10^5) useful for dose-response model calibration
- [OPEN] Whether to pool control data across all four trials or use only specific trials needs consideration given temporal separation (1970-1973)

## Additional Notes

- The paper's primary focus is on vaccine formulation (fresh vs. lyophilized), not dose-response
- The challenge dose of 10^5 organisms was selected to provide ~50% attack rate in controls (effective ID50)
- Fecal excretion data after challenge shows vaccine-induced local intestinal immunity in fresh vaccine recipients (p. 427)
- No adverse reactions observed in 176 vaccinated men (p. 425)
