## Document Type
**REVIEW PAPER** - Comprehensive narrative review of historical Maryland challenge studies (1952-1974)

## Fit Role
**Exclude** - Pure review paper with no new primary data. However, this is an exceptionally valuable secondary source for:
- Synthesizing data across multiple Maryland studies
- Providing context for outcome definitions used historically
- Cross-referencing primary sources (particularly Hornick 1970, Woodward unpublished manuscript)

[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] Exclude from dose-response fitting but retain as key reference for methodology and definitions.

## Study Overview

This review synthesizes findings from the University of Maryland human challenge program (1952-1974), which involved 1,886 total participants, of whom 762 were challenged with the Quailes strain (p. 406).

### Key Historical Context
- Studies conducted at Maryland House of Correction, Jessup, Maryland (p. 406)
- Male prisoner volunteers
- Quailes strain: wild-type, Vi-expressing, phage type D-1, isolated 1958 from chronic carrier's gallbladder (p. 406)
- Challenge agent prepared: stored at -70C in milk, subcultured 6h at 37C before use (p. 406)

## Summary of Challenge Studies Reviewed

### Table 3 (p. 409) - Core Dose-Response Data
Reproduced from Hornick et al. 1970:

| Dose (CFU) | N Challenged | N with Typhoid (%) | Median Incubation (days) | Range |
|------------|--------------|-------------------|-------------------------|-------|
| 10^9 | 42 | 40 (95%) | 5 | 3-32 |
| 10^8 | 9 | 8 (89%) | - | - |
| 10^7 | 32 | 16 (50%) | 7.5 | 4-56 |
| 10^5 | 116 | 32 (28%) | 9 | 6-33 |
| 10^3 | 14 | 0 | - | - |

**Note**: 119 participants in dose-finding studies per p. 409, but Table 3 totals 213. [OPEN] Discrepancy needs clarification - likely includes participants from multiple study phases.

### Strain Comparisons (p. 407)
At 10^7 CFU dose:
- Vi-positive strains (Quailes, Ty2, Zermatt): 51% attack rate
- Vi-negative strains (Ty2W, O-901): 26% attack rate
- 86 participants given 1 of 5 different strains (p. 408)

## Outcome Definitions Compared Across Studies

### Original (Stringent) Definition Used in Maryland Studies
- Oral temperature >= 103F (39.4C) persisting for 24-36 hours (p. 409)
- [ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] This is more stringent than many modern definitions

### Table 4 (p. 410) - Attack Rates by Definition
Reproduced from Glynn et al. 1995 (Ref 54):

| Dose | Temp >=37.8C for 12h, peak >=38.3C | Antibiotics given | Temp >=38.3C for 12h | Temp >=39.4C for 36h (original) |
|------|-----------------------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| 10^8-9 | 96.0% (24/25) | 88.2% (30/34) | 96.0% (24/25) | 72.0% (18/25) |
| 10^7 | 48.1% (13/27) | 48.1% (13/27) | 48.1% (13/27) | 29.6% (8/27) |
| 10^5 | 41.5% (83/200) | 35.3% (72/204) | 38.5% (77/200) | 26.0% (52/200) |
| 10^3 | 0% (0/13) | 0% (0/13) | 0% (0/13) | 0% (0/13) |

**Critical observation**: At 10^5 CFU, attack rate varies from 26% to 41.5% depending on definition (p. 409).

### Temperature Recording Limitations
- "Temperatures were often recorded only once daily during the incubation period" (p. 409)
- Initial temperature rises "more likely to occur in the evening due to diurnal fluctuation" may have been missed (p. 409)

## Additional Clinical Findings (Not in Primary Papers or Synthesized Here)

### Asymptomatic Bacteremia Cases
- 2 of first 64 participants: bacteremic but asymptomatic (p. 409)
- First case: 10^8 CFU, bacteremic 7 days, mild CRP rise, slight headache
- Second case: 10^9 CFU, bacteremic 1 day, slight CRP rise
- Both had "moderately high baseline titres to S. Typhi O and H antigens" (p. 409)
- Additional 3 asymptomatic afebrile bacteremic participants described later (p. 409)

### Military Service Effect on Attack Rates
- At 10^5 CFU challenge: veterans 20% attack rate vs. non-veterans 48% (p. 409)
- 58% protective effect attributed to prior vaccination or exposure (p. 409)
- [ASSISTANT-PROPOSED] This is a major confounder for dose-response estimation

### Bacteremia Detection
- Blood cultures in 75% of those with clinical typhoid (p. 410)
- Peaked in first 2 days of illness, declined rapidly even without antibiotics (p. 410)

### Stool Excretion Patterns (p. 410)
- Days 1-2 post-challenge: 28-30% positive in those developing typhoid vs. 9-12% in those not
- Nadir at day 6: 6% positivity
- Peak at day 20: 61% positivity

## Vaccine Studies Summarized

### Table 1 (pp. 407) - Key Vaccine Challenge Results

| Vaccine | Dose | Efficacy | Reference |
|---------|------|----------|-----------|
| Acetone-killed whole cell | 10^7 (ID50) | No protection | Hornick 1967 |
| Acetone-killed whole cell | 10^5 (ID25) | 67% | Hornick 1967 |
| Phenol-heat-inactivated | 10^7 (ID50) | No protection | Hornick 1967 |
| Phenol-heat-inactivated | 10^5 (ID25) | 75% | Hornick 1967 |
| Denatured Vi polysaccharide | 10^5 | No protection | Hornick 1970 |
| Ty21a with galactose | 10^5 | 87% | Gilman 1977 |
| Ty21a without galactose | 10^5 | 50% | Gilman 1977 |

**Key finding**: "vaccine efficacy appeared to be dependent on the size of the challenge dose, implying that, with the ingestion of a sufficiently high numbers of bacilli, any vaccine-derived immune protection might be overwhelmed" (p. 413)

### Re-challenge Study (p. 411)
- 22 participants with prior blood-culture confirmed typhoid re-challenged within 1 year at 10^5 CFU
- Attack rate: 23% vs. 30% in naive participants challenged concurrently (DuPont 1971)
- Infection-derived immunity "significantly less protective than that induced by effective vaccination" (p. 411)

## Open Questions

[OPEN] The 10^5 CFU data shows n=116 in Table 3 but n=200-204 in Table 4. Need to reconcile with primary sources - likely different study phases or pooled across vaccine control groups.

[OPEN] Unpublished Woodward manuscript (Ref 43) may contain additional data not in published papers. Attempt to locate.

[OPEN] Military service confounder - can this be adjusted for in dose-response modeling using data from Glynn 1995?
