## Study Overview

- **Primary question**: Review and synthesis of volunteer studies evaluating three categories of typhoid vaccines
- **Study type**: Summary review paper of 16-year Maryland volunteer challenge study program (1959-1975)
- **Design**: Retrospective synthesis of multiple individual studies previously published

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** This is a high-level summary/review paper presenting cumulative results from the entire Maryland volunteer program. It does NOT present new primary data but synthesizes results from multiple publications. Should be used to understand overall program scope and cross-check other extracts, but primary papers should take precedence for original data.

### Key Program Statistics (p. 554)
- **Total vaccinated**: 1,886 volunteers
- **Total challenged**: 762 volunteers
- **Time period**: 16 years (1959-1975, implied)
- **Safety**: No life-threatening complications or deaths

---

## Challenge Protocol

### Strain
- **Name**: Quailes strain
- **Source**: Isolated in 1958 from a chronic civilian carrier (p. 554)
- **Storage**: Preserved at -70°C
- **Characteristics**: Never developed resistance to antibiotics; single strain used for ALL challenges in the Maryland program

### Dose & Delivery
The paper describes dose-response findings across the program:

| Dose | Attack Rate in Controls | Notes |
|------|------------------------|-------|
| 10^8 to 10^9 | 90% | Earliest Jessup studies; "much higher attack rate than ordinarily occurs under natural circumstances" (p. 554) |
| 10^6 to 10^7 | 65% | Intermediate dose level (p. 554) |
| 10^5 | 40% | Most commonly used challenge dose; "more than 300 control volunteers" (p. 554) |
| 10^3 | 0% | Lowest dose tested; 0/12 recipients developed disease (p. 554) |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** The 10^5 dose producing 40% attack rate in >300 controls is key calibration data, though it aggregates across studies/years.

### Historical Context
- Early unpublished experience: 6 x 10^6 organisms (NOT Quailes strain) "had not caused disease" (p. 554)
- This led to initial use of higher doses (10^8 to 10^9)

---

## Subject Characteristics

### Population
- Male inmates of the House of Correction, Jessup, Maryland (p. 554)
- Screened by thorough medical and laboratory examination
- Fully informed on at least two occasions about study nature
- Could withdraw at any time
- Multidisciplinary review committee approval of protocols

### Baseline Immunity

**Military Service Status** (p. 555):
This paper provides unique data on effect of prior mandatory military vaccination:

| Military Status | N | Clinical Attack Rate (at 10^5 dose) |
|----------------|---|-------------------------------------|
| Non-veterans (no prior vaccination) | 200 | 48% |
| Veterans (mandatory parenteral typhoid vaccination) | 105 | 20% |

- Military service status recorded in 93% of control individuals
- Protection in veterans had "persisted for an average of 12 years following discharge"
- **Additional finding**: 51 veterans who received effective experimental vaccines had attack rate further lowered to 6%

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** The 48% vs 20% attack rate comparison by military status is critical data for understanding vaccine-induced immunity duration. This is higher quality than the pooled "40% in >300 controls" because it stratifies by prior vaccination status.

**Protective effect calculation** (p. 555):
- Formula given: % effect = 100(b-a)/b where b = control and a = vaccinee
- Veteran protection = 100(48-20)/48 = 58%
- Authors state this is "comparable to that observed in the field trials and had persisted for over a decade"

---

## Outcomes and Definitions

### Primary Outcome
- **Clinical illness/disease**: Not explicitly defined in this paper
- **[OPEN]** Need to cross-reference primary papers for exact disease criteria (fever threshold, culture confirmation, etc.)

### Challenge Timing
- Challenges occurred 1.5 to 9 months following vaccination (p. 554)
- "It was not possible to locate sufficient numbers of vaccinated volunteers beyond this interval so that an evaluation of long-term protection is not possible"

## Dose-Outcome Data Tables

### Table A: Dose-Response Summary for Unvaccinated Controls

| Dose (organisms) | N | Attack Rate | Source/Notes |
|------------------|---|-------------|--------------|
| 10^8 - 10^9 | Not specified | 90% | Early studies (p. 554) |
| 10^6 - 10^7 | Not specified | 65% | (p. 554) |
| 10^5 | >300 | 40% | "Most subsequent studies" (p. 554) |
| 10^3 | 12 | 0% | "No disease was caused" (p. 554) |

**[OPEN]** The dose ranges (e.g., "10^6 to 10^7") suggest pooling across doses - need to check primary papers for exact dose-specific data.

### Table B: Vaccine Efficacy Summary at 10^5 Challenge Dose

| Vaccine Type | Administration | Protection (%) | p-value | Notes |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|---------|-------|
| Acetone-inactivated (K) | Parenteral, 1-3 doses | 67% | 0.02 | WHO field trial equivalent |
| Phenol-heat-inactivated (L) | Parenteral, 1-3 doses | 75% | 0.009 | WHO field trial equivalent |
| Purified Vi antigen | Parenteral | 0% (negative) | NS | 13-fold increase in Vi antibody but "entirely incapable of inducing protection" |
| Killed oral (German product) | Oral, 2x recommended dose | 15% | NS | "Minimal" protection; no serum antibody response |
| Streptomycin-dependent mutant (fresh) | Oral, multiple doses | 74% | 0.0002 | Protection "virtually obliterated" with lyophilized form |
| Epimerase-less mutant (galE) | Oral, 5-8 doses of 3x10^7 each | 87% | Not given | "Most successful" in Maryland studies |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** The epimerase-less mutant (Ty21a precursor) showing 87% protection is the highest efficacy reported in the Maryland program.

### Table C: Military Service Effect at 10^5 Challenge Dose

| Group | N | Attack Rate | % Effect vs Non-veterans |
|-------|---|-------------|-------------------------|
| Non-veterans (controls) | 200 | 48% | -- |
| Veterans only | 105 | 20% | 58% |
| Veterans + effective experimental vaccine | 51 | 6% | 88% |

## Fit Role Assessment

**Role**: **SUPPORT** (Review/Summary)

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** Rationale:

This is a **summary review paper** that does NOT present new primary data. It synthesizes 16 years of Maryland volunteer study results previously published in individual papers.

**Value for dose-response modeling:**
1. Provides high-level program overview and total sample sizes
2. Military service stratification (veterans vs non-veterans) is valuable for understanding long-term vaccine-induced immunity
3. Dose-response summary (Table A) useful for cross-checking primary papers
4. Documents that 10^5 dose in >300 controls yielded 40% attack rate (key calibration point)

**Limitations for modeling:**
1. No new data beyond what is in primary papers
2. Dose ranges pooled rather than exact doses
3. Denominators often missing or approximate
4. Cannot distinguish individual study heterogeneity

**Recommendation**: Use this paper to:
- Cross-reference and validate data from primary papers
- Understand overall program structure and vaccine types tested
- Extract military service stratification data (unique to this paper)
- Identify primary papers that need extraction

## Key Extractions for Calibration

### Dose-Response Points (Unvaccinated Controls)

| Dose | N | Disease | Rate | Quality |
|------|---|---------|------|---------|
| 10^3 | 12 | 0 | 0% | Good - exact N |
| 10^5 | >300 | ~120 | 40% | Approximate - pooled |
| 10^6-10^7 | ? | ? | 65% | Poor - pooled doses, no N |
| 10^8-10^9 | ? | ? | 90% | Poor - pooled doses, no N |

### Military Service Stratification (at 10^5 dose)

| Group | N | Disease | Rate |
|-------|---|---------|------|
| Non-veterans | 200 | 96 | 48% |
| Veterans | 105 | 21 | 20% |

**[ASSISTANT-PROPOSED]** The 28% absolute difference (48% vs 20%) in attack rates between non-veterans and veterans at the same challenge dose provides evidence that parenteral vaccination protection persists at least 12 years on average. This is among the strongest evidence for long-term vaccine durability in the literature.

## Open Questions

1. **[OPEN]** The overall control attack rate is stated as 40% in >300 controls, but non-veterans specifically had 48% rate. This suggests the >300 includes a mix of veterans and non-veterans. Need to determine if primary papers stratify by military status.

2. **[OPEN]** The dose ranges "10^6 to 10^7" and "10^8 to 10^9" suggest data were pooled across doses. Primary papers should be checked for exact dose-specific attack rates.

3. **[OPEN]** Attack rate at 10^5 varies: 40% overall (p. 554), 48% non-veterans, 20% veterans (p. 555). This 40% may be weighted average. Need to reconcile with primary paper data.

4. **[OPEN]** The Egyptian field trial of epimerase-less mutant showing "100% protection after one year" is described as "preliminary unpublished results" - need to find if this was subsequently published.

5. **[OPEN]** Disease definition criteria not provided in this paper - need to extract from primary papers (likely Hornick et al. 1967 or 1970).
